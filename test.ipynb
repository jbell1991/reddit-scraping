      "\n",
      "As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.\n",
      "VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. \n",
      "2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.\n",
      "3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to \"neutralish\" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul.

      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "# Public Transparency\n",
      "\n",
      ">The SEC must dramatically improve short-interest reporting.  All short interests must be publicly reported in a (1) timely, (2) comprehensive, and (3) standalone manner designed to maximize the informational value that rationalizes short selling (and other short interests) in the securities markets.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">**Recommendations:**  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***1) Form  13F:***   The  SEC  must  implement  a  long  overdue Form  13F filing  requirement  for institutional investment managers that (1) includes a standalone short-interest schedule as a supplement to existing long-position reporting, (2) contemplates public reporting of all threshold short interests, including those involving securities lending/borrowing, options, and equity derivatives positions, and (3) is published on at least a monthly (as opposed to quarterly) basis, with an appropriately minimal delay calibrated solely to protect trading strategies.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***2) Securities  Lending  Reporting:***   The  SEC must implement  section  984(b)  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which instructed the commission to “increase the transparency  of  information  available  to  brokers,  dealers, and  investors,  with  respect  to  the  loan  or borrowing of securities” and which was supposed to be completed “\\[n\\]ot later than 2 years after the date of \\[the Dodd-Frank Act’s\\] enactment” in July 2010.1This flagrant disregard of a Congressional directive must  be  remedied  with a securities-lending regulatory  and  public reporting framework (see also comments relating to the consolidated audit trail below).  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***3) FINRA  Broker-Dealer  Reporting:***   The  SEC  must  require the Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority (“FINRA”) to implement daily aggregate short interest reporting for broker-dealers, as it has implemented for the equity  trade  reporting  facilities (see footnote  2 below).    Presently, FINRA Rule  4560 requires broker-dealers  to  report  total  short  positions  in  all  customer  and  proprietary  accounts in  all  equity securities  only twice  per  month. As above,  we  encourage  the  SEC  and  FINRA  to  require  broker-dealer short interest reporting with an appropriately minimal delay.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***4) FINRA  Equity  Trade  Reporting  Facilities  &  Exchange  Reporting:***  The  SEC must  implement  regulations requiring FINRA to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC.  The SEC must similarly implement regulations requiring the securities exchanges to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC. The SEC must also consider consolidating information in a descriptive monthly short-sale report and making some portion of the data available through its data visualization tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Regulatory Safeguards:\n",
      "\n",
      ">The  SEC  must  ensure that short  selling  is  subject  to a reasonable,  unambiguous regulatory  framework that restricts  and  deters short-selling  practices that interfere  with  fair,  orderly,  and efficient markets.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">**Recommendations:**  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***5) Eliminate Market-Maker Exception to the Locate Requirement:***  The SEC must institute a broad prohibition on naked short selling (see Appendix A below) and abandon the market-making exception to the Locate Requirement in Regulation SHO.3 That loophole permits the largest proprietary trading firms to engage in naked short selling on the theory that it facilitates trading in hard-to-borrow securities. However, the SEC’s settlement regulations with respect to mandatory buy-ins already provide special accommodations to market-makers that cannot close out their short positions within the failure-to-delivery (“FTD”) close-out timeframe.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***6) Short Position Accountability and Limits:***  The SEC must implement a net short position accountability and position limits framework, along with a special filing requirement for market participants that have net short positions at least in hard-to-borrow equities deemed excessive (i.e., exceeding an SEC-determined threshold) relative to the total tradeable float in a security.  Stocks experiencing aggregate short interest in excess of 90 percent of the tradeable float in the security, for example, should trigger imposition of this position limits framework.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***7) Uptick Rule:***  The SEC should reinstitute the Uptick Rule, which ameliorated price declines associated with short-selling  for  almost  70  years  without  significant  effects  on  the  development  of  the  U.S.  capital markets.  The SEC’s elimination of that rule prior to the 2008 financial crisis was unnecessary and poorly conceived.  Although there is merit to the Alternative Uptick Rule, we are not persuaded that a single-day 10 percent downturn in a company’s share  price  should  be required  to  reinstate uptick restrictions on short selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Operational Integrity:\n",
      "\n",
      ">The SEC must ensure that operational integrity is maintained throughout the clearing and settlement system.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">**Recommendations**:  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***8) Mandatory  Buy-Ins  and Punitive  Fee  Assessments:***   The  SEC  must continue  to require  clearing broker-dealers to immediately close out failures-to-deliver (“FTDs”) during the settlement process,4which should include mandatory (1) buy-in processes on T+2 for short sales (in a T+1 settlement framework); and(2) fee  assessments designed  to  punish  and  deter firms  with  FTDs that are  not  closed  out  timely under Regulation SHO. Fee assessments should climb as the outstanding period for a short-selling-related FTD lengthens.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***9) T+1 Settlement:***  The SEC must shorten the settlement cycle to T+1 (i.e., trade-date-plus-one-trading-day), which would reduce operational and other risks in our settlement system, including risks associated with FTDs and naked short selling.The securities markets currently operate on a T+2 time horizon.  Because margin models at the National Securities Clearing Corporation account for risks during the period of time that elapses between the trading and settlement of transactions, a shorter time horizon for settlement—like  T+1—would  not  only  reduce  risks to  the  clearing and  settlement system  but  also  generally  reduce liquidity  demands  and  risks  to  clearing  firms  that  must  meet  margin  calls  calibrated  to  the  risks  and volatilities expected for the firm’s overall portfolio during the unsettled risk period.In addition to these benefits, the shortened T+1 settlement period may diminish the number of unsettled transactions arising from  the  re-lending  process,  which  has  been  characterized  as  creating  temporary  “phantom”  or “duplicate” shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Monitoring  and Enforcement:\n",
      "\n",
      ">The  SEC  must  ensure that  the Division  of  Enforcement (‘DOE”) has  the information to protect investors and markets and punish and deter unlawful short selling practices, including manipulation and fraud  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">**Recommendation:**  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">***10) Consolidated Audit Trail:***  Short selling information will be part of the CAT, once operationalized.  The SEC therefore must promptly implement the long-overdue and industry-delayed CAT,so that its divisions can analyze timely  and  comprehensive  information  on  short-selling  for  oversight,  enforcement,  and  policy purposes.See our CAT fact sheet.The SEC also must require regulatory and public reporting of certain information  relating  to securities-lending  activities.    Thus,  it  must  explore  requiring  securities-lending reporting as part of the CAT .\n",
      "\n",
      "# Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      ">Recent data analyzed by the SEC suggests that short selling may comprise as much as half of all listed equity share volume.5Despite  this  fact,  the  practice  is  subject  to  a  rudimentary  regulatory  framework.    Our  recommendations  for reasonable  short-selling  transparency requirements,  regulatory  safeguards,  operational  improvements,  and  monitoring and enforcement measures would enhance the current SEC framework, protect fair, orderly, and efficient trading, level the informational and trading playing field for investors, and better serve issuers (companies), investors, and the purposes of the securities markets—i.e., to support capital formation and the integrity of the price discovery process that informs capital allocation.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">Unless the SEC makes significant progress in each of the four identified areas, certain short selling practices in the U.S. securities markets will continue to undermine investor and issuer confidence, as well as the fundamental purposes of our markets.\n",

This submission period ends in May and we can see something by the beginning of next year, and marketing later this year as well as a beta version.

LDI beat EPS by 73.03% and beat Revenue by 30.38% for example. They also announced a special dividend of .69 and announced they are looking to set a dividend of 8 cents a quarter starting in Q2 of 2021.\n",

      "o LDI’s Partner Channel is through the whole sale channel, and through Joint Venture’s with Home Builders. However, the actual volume remains unmoved. Rate locks decreased from last quarter. It stood at 9.645 last quarter, but only 8.688 this quarter. While Loan Originations only increased from 7,730,101 to 8,051,362. We can assume this was largely off their Joint Venture with Home Builders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- UWMC is expecting Closed Loan Volume of between $52 and $57 Billion for Q1 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "o On CNBC their CEO stated they were right in the middle, however the April bump in refinance activity and purchase activity as rates eased down back under 3% likely gave them the boost they needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "o Reopening the spigot on Jumbo Loans and FHA loans (while ensuring a fantastic Q2) will help raise closed loan volume for Q1 2021 as Jumbo only accounted for 583,299 in 2020 but 3,570,520 for 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "§ They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker’s business by expanding their Jumbo Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWMC’s CEO.\n",
      "\n",

      "\\- UWMC is expecting a gain margin of 200-220 BPS or 2%-2.20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "o However, a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin means a 2.29% Gain on Sale margin. Which means a 9 Basis Point beat. If, like LDI, there is margin expansion due to UWMC’s tech then this could mean even more of a margin gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "o A 28.2% gain on sale margin decrease leads to a 2.19% gain on sale margin for Q1 2021. However, please note that UWMC’s tech could lead to margin expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "o I believe UWMC will fall roughly to 2.50-2.60%, but we will see on the 10th After Market. I do not mind a margin hit for market share gain, so long as that market share gain is sustainable OR the market share gain leads to revenue that offsets the gain on sale margin.\n",

      "\\- If LDI had no, or little, marketing expenses it would have had higher net income than Q4 2020. Rocket’s marketing expenses totaled 320 Million. They have such high marketing expenses because they are retail, whereas UWMC is wholly wholesale and thus their marketing costs are much, much, less.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Rocket got clobbered on their wholesale channel after UWMC’s ultimatum. The Wholesale Channel was one of their main growth drivers, especially in the purchase channel where they are exceptionally weak. (11 percent refinance, but only 3 percent of the purchase volume in the US).\n",
      "\n",
      "o The Partner Network for Q1 2021 only provided 40.7B in originations (Please remember that this is not just wholesale but wholesale comprises a portion). Last Quarter the Partner Channel provided 37.9B in originations. That was a 7.3% increase, which is negligible when you consider that they probably only grew from their referral channel and from the increased percentage of their business that those who did not sign the addendum from UWMC gave.  You cannot have that when your direct-to-consumer channel decreased from 67.8B to 65B. Especially when your retail channel is the higher margin channel. Net revenue obviously decreased in their partner network from Q4 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "§ I cannot reiterate how bad this is for Rocket considering their aggressive growth was coming from this area. Especially since the broker channel surpassed 20 percent this year according to AMCs for the first time since 2008. It’s indicating to me that UWMC has won the broker war here, to be quite blunt, especially since UWMC’s CEO keeps reiterating that he has over 10,000 Brokerages partnered with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- RKT gave disappointing Q2 guidance with a significant decrease in closed loan volume of between 82.5 Billion and 87.5 Billion. Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.\n",
      "\n",
      "o Quite frankly, considering UWMC has stated that Q2 is going to be very, very, good… I am concerned for Rocket, especially since there is a government program coming online this summer that will help low credit score and low-income people refinance which UWMC is taking advantage of. Furthermore, the wholesale broker channel is increasing, and more and more housing inventory is coming online. Lastly, home prices are increasing. If UWMC has a revenue beat and closed loan volume beat like LDI, or even meets Q1 on the higher end and guides upward for Q2, that means that Rocket is likely capped on the wholesale channel and thus in the purchase segment and that UJWMC is gaining ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Thoughts Going into Earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite frankly, I am positively inclined. Which makes you all think I am a moron most likely. Well, in a vacuum, yes, it would be a moronic play. However, the market’s priced UWMC to fail partly because it is a mortgage company, partly because of the uncertainty with Rocket, and partly because it does not believe UWMC can beat expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us first look at P/E Ratio. Rocket had a P/E of roughly 13-13.5, whereas UWMC has a P/E ratio of 6.27 if the 1.22 FY 2020 is right. Financial Services company have a P/E Ratio of 8-10. While Rocket is the number 1 mortgage lender (with some arguing it was even worthy of tech valuation???), UWMC is the number 1 mortgage lender in the wholesale space. However, the market was looking for Rocket to completely outperform like other stocks and for guidance to be spectacular, much like other companies. The Market is looking at UWMC like it is going to fail, as it is falling below even the most conservative ratio for a financial services company and has been trending downward in the leadup to earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another bearish sign from the market is the short interest of UWMC compared to RKT. RKT’s short interest is 7.87% since April 15 (April 30th SI data should be released any day now). For UWMC it is 13.10% of the float, and I am guessing it is going to show an increase on the 30th. Volume for UWMC is also significantly low from its average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads me to my next point. I believe in war you must strike fast, and strike hard, which UWMC did. However, markets do not like uncertainty, and the ultimatum that UJWMC gave introduced a lot of uncertainty. However, UWMC has made a lot of positive noises before Rocket’s earnings, and so I was comfortable that they were winning the wholesale mortgage market war. I also quite thoroughly enjoyed their share raising moves, and their willingness to raise capacity. I did not really see that with Rocket. However, Rocket had its buyback program whereas UWMC did not have that to fall to and it led to a negative feedback loop for UWMC where people gave up, short selling occurred, and there were not really any buybacks that UWMC could do as opposed to RKT to halt the bleeding. Ultimately, RKT’s earnings even led to a sympathy bleeding on UWMC in the After Hours. UWMC is down 1.79% to 7.66 after RKT’s earnings, even though these two companies are diametrically opposed, and the success of one boded ill for the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first positive thing is that analysts’ earnings are primed to be blown out of the water for Q1 and FY 2021 as well as FY 2022. Q1 2021 has analysts expecting .42 or .47 depending on where you look, but I think that is a bit low. Especially when compared to Redwood Trust and LDI. I’m positively inclined here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, LDI used 200 Million to give a .69 Special Dividend, but the stock was trading over 20-22 dollars at the time, and its announcement of a Q2 dividend announcement of 8 cents a share was unappealing considering the share price. At the current share price of 18.11 LDI would give a 1.7% annual dividend. At the current share price LoanDepot is giving a 3.81% special dividend. Compare that to UWMC which is offering a dividend yield of 5.22%, and who has announced that they were looking at a special dividend, increased dividend, or even buybacks in Q4 2020 to reward shareholders if there was excess cash. After LDI and RKT both issued a special dividend, I feel UWMC will have no choice but to do so, and a special dividend of 200 Million to Class A shares equates to 4 dollars roughly. Even if Class D shares were involved, a 40-cent special dividend to both Class D and A shares would only cost 640 million.  However, I believe that the owner wants to keep as much money in the company as possible because he wants to invest it in the company which is why Class D shares do not have a dividend, but Class A shares do. If you are still unconvinced, I believe a timely look at RKT’s special dividend is in order as they issued the special dividend to only Class A shares (Public shares and not owner shares), and not the Class D shares that Dan Gilbert owns. This structure also allows an outsized special dividend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have 7.50 call Options with an average premium of 1.20. This would cost 123 million if issued to only Class A shares. In a vacuum, to profit I would only need a special dividend of $1.20, though this will not be in a vacuum. A special dividend that large would force people to cover if they are shorting, for one, and this special dividend would be issued under the auspices of Russell inclusion in late June, A strong Q1 and a very strong Q2 Guidance. Furthermore, as the normal dividend is announced the share price would elevate by that amount, before falling after the ex-dividend date. If the share price instead falls or remains flat, I can exercise my shares and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage Servicing Rights alone can service the dividend (41.5 Million per year), and the interest on the bonds (80 Million), while also allowing the company to further invest or allocate to bond principal. The Senior Notes are themselves easily repaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I have 4525 shares of UWMC that I have been continuously adding to, and I have 25 7.5 Calls for May 21 at an average of 1.20 that I have also been adding to including the last 2 days for both calls and shares. I am looking to add a call, and perhaps a tad more shares to UWMC. Yes, I am aware of IV Crush, and of Theta Decay. The theta decay stands at 1.9% which is acceptable to me, and I believe considering the confluence of events, the positive noises that the CEO has made for Q2 2021, the short interest, and the strong downward pressure on UWMC indicating the market believes the company will completely miss earnings, as well as the overt indication and peer pressure to issue a special dividend will ensure that the IV will remain elevated after earnings. I would not advise this for the faint of hearts, or if you have a kid on the way and life savings to burn, but this is one of the few times where buying calls from theta gang might mean they cry, and you fly (upward). With that said, be aware of IV Crush and be aware that I have allocated 3,127$ and might up this to 3,200 roughly considering Rocket’s earnings. I have nearly 40,000 in UWMC, so this is by no means a majority position. Furthermore, I am somewhat cushioned as this is not a weekly. To be clear, this is a YOLO, but a conservative one (sans the options). I also have money in my bank, so it is not like this will render me homeless.\n",

If all these were to be executed that's 59.8m shares. So 59.8 (call OI) + 44.7(shares shorted) = 104.5m shares. The public float is 109.8m shares. Vanguard holds 26.2m shares. If you add these 26.2m shares to the 104.5m shares that is a total of = 130.7m shares. 20m+ shares MORE than the public float?

They had a big money investor that backstopped them is the only reason they survived.

While the financial figures were encouraging, with strong increases in margins carrying a lower-than-expected revenue to beat EPS expectations, it was the qualitative unveilings that I believe were of the most significance here in terms of our ability to start to imagine the GM that we will have ten years from now.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Numbers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I mentioned above, I'm not going to dive hugely into the numbers here, but I will provide an overview of some factors that I found interesting/important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite narrowly failing to meet revenue expectations, recording 32.47 billion vs. the expected 32.67 billion, GM managed to knock analysts' earnings per share estimates out of the park generating $2.25/share against the predicted $1.04.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is largely in thanks to really positive improvements in margins across the board, with Q1 2021 vs Q4 2020 figures as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross margin: 11.22% up from 7.96%\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating margin: 10.09% up from 7.38%\n",
      "\n",
      "Net margin: 9.31% up from 7.59%\n",
      "\n",
      "According to CEO Mary Barra, these margin improvements were put down to a strong performance in GM's finance product segment (a segment with lower overheads than manufacturing, etc), the leverage of virtual engineering programs and other software solutions to refine engineering and prototype manufacturing processes, and strong sales figures for GM's higher-margin SUVs and Pickups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps most importantly here, GM maintains its initial guidance for this year and is confident that it will not be further impacted by the semiconductor shortage that has seen the auto-sector reeling lately. They predict EBIT of $10-11 billion for this year (strongly beating annual EBIT from 2018 through to 2020), despite the prolonged semiconductor shortage's impact on manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also of note, but to a lesser extent, is that the company has reduced its total liabilities, marginally improved its cash position, and reduced its interest costs, all while increasing its total inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Words**\n",
      "\n",
      "Put it simply, GM appears to be positioning itself at the leading edge of mainstream America's EV adoption and will be a powerhouse in the EV industry globally for decades to come. Tesla makes incredible products and probably deserves the hype, but GM has the scale, infrastructure, and history to truly make its rollout impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is quickly positioning itself as vertically integrated, after having invested heavily in battery research, design, and manufacturing capabilities. GM's scientists have developed battery technology that can deliver 450 miles per full charge and performance of 0-60mph in 3 seconds while allowing for flexible design considerations that can be adapted for the needs of each vehicle. These statistics will only improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM's scientists and engineers were able to quickly adapt to the semiconductor shortage by developing new workarounds involving less rare semis or to find new solutions to old problems which in some cases have subverted the need to use semis in these cases. In my opinion, this is indicative of a high-performing engineering crew who promise to continue to be adaptable as the company moves forward into new ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to upcoming models which are scheduled for release in 2022/23, Barra states-\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and ***government*** customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The keyword here is 'government'. The Biden administration pledged in January to replace the entire US federal government's vehicle fleet with EVs- [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos-idUSKBN29U2LW](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos-idUSKBN29U2LW)\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is no guarantee of agreement in place that GM will be the company that meets this demand, the replacement fleet will consist of 650,000 EVs at a possible cost of over $20 billion. Obviously, the administration will want to spend this money domestically, and GM will be a front-runner for these contracts. If GM even takes in 20% of this amount, they will be able to significantly reduce long-term debt (thereby reducing operating costs moving forward and increasing margins), accelerate their investments into new ventures, or simply add the profit to their books.\n",

      "\n",
      "Paramount Resources is one of the oldest publicly-traded oil and gas companies with over 2 million net acres of land in Canada. The stock is trading at multi-year lows, and I believe has an expected return of between 200% and 300% in the next year. The most important catalyst should happen very soon: growth in Q2/19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta. Given the age of the company (IPO in 1978), legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields, and requires much less capital to sustain. With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti, Paramount’s production should increase after a year of declining. To oversimplify: oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected. With Paramount’s stock near 20-year lows, and production about to start growing after a year of declining, the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of \\~$20/share. I believe downside is limited (outside of macro oil price shocks), given how low expectations are. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Business Description:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Paramount has production from three regions, but for simplicity’s sake, only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case. The three regions are: Grand Prairie (where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside), Kaybob Region (will likely decline 15-20% per year) and Central Alberta (will likely decline 10-15% per year). The most important region is Grand Prairie, which is currently 1/3rd of production, and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions. Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months, making them amongst the top oil wells in North America. Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results. The Wapiti region, which is right next door to Karr, just had their first wells turn online in April/May when Keyera’s gas processing facility came online. The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti. \n",
      "\n",
      "**History and Why the Stock is Mispriced**\n",
      "\n",
      "Today’s investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years. In 2017, Paramount bought Apache’s assets in Canada. The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta; however, production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid-2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region. This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth. Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd. However, actual production came in at 86kboepd. Paramount’s stock fell, as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bear thesis on POU is simple: production went from 95kboepd in Q4/17 to 85kboepd in Q4/18 despite $600m of capex and management’s initial promise of 100kboped of production. Bears don’t believe management’s new 2019 guidance for growth to 85-90kboepd in Q4/19 with only $350m of capex. These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20-year lows today. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bridge from 95kbodp in Q4/17 to 85kboepd Q4/18 is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 5kboepd less from an asset sale (Resthaven land)\n",
      "* \\~5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land (exploration region that didn’t work – guidance should have been set more conservatively).\n",
      "* \\~5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Expectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low. I believe Paramount’s production will exit at nearly 100mboepd (guidance is for 85-90). My simple math is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Karr:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Q4/18 production was \\~27kboepd. This has been their best asset recently, and production was kept flat in 2018 (exit to exit) because of midstream constraints. The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H/18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The company had zero production here in Q4/18, but began turning online wells in May/April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online. The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year, and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd. If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year. These wells start off at much higher rates initially, and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately. I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing \\~20kboepd\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaybob region:\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is a mature old field with a \\~20% decline rate. The company is drilling a few new wells here, and I think production will decline 5% from Q4/18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4/19\n",
      "\n",
      "Central Alberta:\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is another mature old and gas field with a \\~15% decline rate. I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4/18 to 17kboepd in Q4/19. \n",
      "\n",
      "Summary Q4/19 estimate: Karr at 30, Wapiti at 20, Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 = 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85-90. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team, which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set, did not want to repeat the old team’s mistakes from last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Why will Wapiti results be good?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Paramount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter, and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August. Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region, which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year. Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount’s Wapiti region. Below is a map to show proximity:\n",
      "\n",
      "Paramount’s Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of \\~15 months and IRRs of 45% at $55 oil. Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount’s Wapiti estimates:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Paramount’s Karr region: directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here. Average returns are 64% with 18-month payouts. \n",
      "* NuVista’s Gold Creek acreage: directly west of Wapiti with 40% IRRs. Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve.\n",
      "* Pipestone Energy’s acreage: directly north of Wapiti with 60% IRRs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All IRRs referenced above assume a $55 WTI oil price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potential asset sales: Given the age of the company, Paramount has plenty of assets (both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure) that they could sell. Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr. Karr is currently Paramount’s best land (64% IRRs referenced above) and inventory life is substantial. Below is my math on Karr’s potential infrastructure value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "Upside: If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd, estimated they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020. At $55 oil (WTI) and $5 condensate differentials, EBITDA would be \\~$600m. (My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability). Subtracting debt of $800m, and assuming 5x EBITDA, equity value is over $2.2bn and $17/share.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Downside: If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of $350m (most sell side is bearish/neutral on the stock) and apply a low 4x multiple, after subtracting $800m of debt the valuation target becomes $4.60/share. Downside is therefore \\~30%. I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason (infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past). \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Abandonment liability: Paramount has a \\~$800m abandonment liability, which it pays out \\~$30m per year. Recently in Alberta, the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt. As such, some investors are concerned that Paramount’s large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company’s liquidity. However, Paramount’s revolver does not mature until November of 2022. The company has drawn $800m on their $1.5bn revolver, and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim. I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020, and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022. \n",
      "* Guidance in 2019 is reduced – bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018, and the company’s track record of executing against guidance isn’t good. If, for whatever reason, Paramount reduces 2019 guidance (because Wapiti wells are below type curve, or infrastructure issues creep up again), I think downside to the stock is 30%. Please see my valuation section above. \n",
      "* Oil/gas prices – this risk is common to any oil and gas company. One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer. \n",

So, what happened and why should you not bet against the S&P500?\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The S&P500 has the most liquid options market in the world and the way in which options are hedged means that market makers are usually forced to buy after extended drawdowns.  Large institutions like pension funds have a tremendous amount of equities on their books and these assets need to be hedged in times of stress.  When a big risk event comes along these big dogs will buy puts to protect their holdings.  They will also sell calls using their equities as collateral to bring in some premium throughout the year regardless of risk.  The market makers are on the other side of this trade, so that are usually assumed to be long calls and short puts.  Let's just look at short puts for now.  If you are a market maker then you want to eliminate your directional risk.  Since short puts will lose you money if the underlying goes down you can short shares to hedge your short put.  Remember now that puts have two huge components that determine price:  volatility and how close the market is to the strike.  When a bunch of short puts are in the money then it will have a high delta.  This means that the MM's will need to short a ton of shares to hedge the large delta.  The big kicker here is that, for one, volatility is mean reverting, and two, that the option will eventually expire.  When volatility mean reverts, as it must since risk is not constant in our world, the deltas on the short call will reduce.  Less delta means that MMs are short too many shares and they need to buy (this is the effect of vanna).  Hence vix drop = share buys (in general, not always).  The second factor is that eventually the options will expire and hence the market maker will no longer need to short into dips to hedge their gamma, meaning there is less selling pressure.  They might even need to buy to get flat from all the short stock they have after their options expire.  It is no coincidence that the huge rally we saw in 2020 off the covid lows happened the day after a massive amount of in the money options expired during March quad witching.

      "2.    Bond  yields are incredibly low and this creates a risk on appetite.  If you are rich where do you put your money right now?  If you put it in bonds then you are not even going to beat inflation and, moreover, if yields spike, your bond will be worth significantly less.  These factors make bonds with long duration a risk both immediately and also in opportunity cost.  We can put our money into an asset that will do nothing or we can put it into a large index like the S&P500 where, over 10 years, we know that we can probably get at least 20% out of it.  The best part is that big money can easily hedge its directional risk by buying puts and, if needed, sell calls against holdings to pay for the put.  This means big $$$ can get protection for free.  All this infers that there is a natural flow of money  into the market.  Evaluations might be crazy high right now but they start to make more sense when you adjust it for bond yields.

I might be retarded, but I'm pretty sure today is going to mark the first day of a short squeeze with Corsair and unlike a lot of the other shitty \"short squeeze incoming... hopefully\" (looking at you CLOV) posts on WSB this one is going to happen (is happening) whether you Apes are in or not. I'm only here because I made a fuckton of money on GME earlier this year and I want to give something back to the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the rub:\n",
      "\n",
      "Corsair is a premier PC accessories company that's been around for a couple decades, but just went public towards the end of last year. Since then they have [KILLED their earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR) EVERY. SINGLE. QUARTER. coming in an average of 60% above the analyst expectations and yet somehow there's 20% short interest on the stock. At first they weren't issuing guidance because pandemic, but yesterday before the bell they reported earnings that were 75.80% above expectations AND RAISED GUIDANCE for 2021 from \\~$1.875bil to \\~$2bil and yet somehow the stock dropped from $35 premarket to $31.50 at the low of the day because the market is too busy trying to squeeze imaginary currencies recommended by the meme's of eccentric billionaires right now I guess. This is especially moronic because the fundamentals are so incredibly good for this company. As it currently stands market cap is roughly $3 billion, with expected revenue of $2 billion for the year and EBITDA earnings estimated for 2021 at around $250 million. In other words, CRSR has a forward P/E of about 12 right now and Price to Sales of 1.5x, low enough to make a value company blush, and yet this is a rocket fueled growth company in a rapidly expanding growth sector with 20% short interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Digging a little deeper:\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did the price swing 10% from high to low yesterday, but it was a high volume day for CRSR in general and for some reason the shares short made up [73% of the volume for the day](https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr). That's right, the shorts really thought shorting another 1 million shares was the right thing to do after that rock star earnings report. This is truly, catastrophically retarded. Today the stock has been up as high as $36.11 and has been holding steady above $35. If we check how many short shares are available on iborrowdesk it looks like the shorts [haven't even started covering today](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR) from their short positions that were created yesterday AND there are only about 350k short shares available to borrow right now meaning the shorts have very little ammo to try to push the stock down or hunt for stop losses. Those million short shares from yesterday are all currently under water and when they start to cover this is going to push up even higher which will trigger the rest of the 20% of the short interest to consider covering their positions and get out now. There's a word for this kind of chain reaction, what is it..? Oh yeah, SHORT. SQUEEZE.\n",

This isn't just a short squeeze play, this is a long term value play (Logitech, Corsairs major competitor, trades at a 20.5 P/E, so if all we did was reach their P/E with no more earnings growth (ha) we would be at about $55 per share). If you buy now YOU WILL MAKE MONEY.

Specifically, the Biden Administration has set July 4th as the date for true reopening assuming we can get enough people vaccinated. I see this as a key date to watch.

Roughly speaking it will take an operator about 20 days to drill a well to total depth and completion according to SM at the beginning of the year however they are one of the fastest drilling and completion teams in the Permain Basin. https://s22.q4cdn.com/545644856/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-SM-Energy-Presentation.pdf SLIDE 14\n",

So wells drilled in this style would take between 160-720 days. (Now for a less aggressive estimate we can assume that some companies complete multiple wells together and this is known as Simulfrac which would cut the completion time in half for large groups. For sake of optimism lets just say 80-360 days. This means wells that are drilled now wont be online to keep production flat until about fall at the earliest and next year at the latest.\n",

My case actually still works for this year even if both Iran and OPEC+ start pumping due to the demand rebound that will cause a terrific spike in prices. \n",

      "Starting with infrastructure, a key importance in maintaining national and international markets is supply chain management. You have to be able to move product. American companies can't currently move product across state lines en mass. While my knowledge of the legality of interstate transport is scarce currently, but definitely gonna sign up for a cannabis law course soon, The basics are that movement of recreational marijuana across state lines is interstate trafficking. Therefore, most marijuana companies in America only cultivate local markets. Canadian companies like ACB, TLRY, VFF, etc. have already cultivated national market infrastructure as well as infrastructure to affect international trade. US companies are gonna open at a half-decade disadvantage in this sub-market.\n",

In fact, one of the most widely available brands I've seen is Bettie's Eddies, and those are only in 4 states. Canadian companies are starting with marketable brands. I've been wrong before plenty of times, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that these companies would dominate an American marketplace with federal legalization around the corner. Tilray will easily be the mass market distributor of medical cannabis. Aurora will likely be the most recognizable premium cannabis distributor, especially in more hipster oriented markets like Portland, Seattle, LA, New York, etc., and Village Farms will likely be the largest provider of non-premium recreational products. \n",

      "While I understand the thought process that American legalization will be a major boon for American companies, the capabilities of these companies seems more and more lacking. With ACB's license to sell in Mexico, it will likely become the largest distributor in North America.

      "* The KC-46 Pegasus (tanker). BA has compromised this project from start to half-assed finish. In the early 2000s, the Pentagon proposed leasing tankers based on Boeing's 767 commercial design, but a congressional investigation revealed corruption leading up to that decision. The leasing plans were canceled, and there was an executive overhaul at Boeing--upper management was so rotten it'd knock a buzzard off a shit wagon. In 2008 the 767 design lost out to a modified Airbus A330 (designed by Airbus and Northrop Grumman), but the decision was overturned. Why? Because as usual Boeing bitched and moaned louder than your wife's boyfriend. The eventual contract with Boeing capped the Air Force's spending on the KC-46 project at $4.9B and required BA to pay for overages. Now let me tell ya, if brains were leather, BA management wouldn't have enough to saddle a junebug; these cucks have spent $5B+ in pre-tax charges due to fines and cost overruns as of January 2021. This means BA has paid as much in cost overruns for the KC-46 program as the Air Force invested in the tanker's development; these guys are dumber than a sack of rocks at a water factory. So, initial delivery was slated for August 2017, but the first plane didn't show up until January 2019. Then about a month later the fleet was grounded because inspectors found tools and construction debris inside the completed aircraft. The pilots even came out and said they were not flying the planes due to debris issues and lack of confidence in the plane. The Air Force, in ~2018, noted several deficiencies that Boeing needs to work out before deliveries can begin. Notably, issues with the tanker's remote-vision system have caused the process of extending the boom used to refuel jets mid-flight to be inconsistent, leading to the probe scratching the jet's outer surface. That's both dangerous for in-flight operations and could potentially rub the stealth coating off fighters, making them more vulnerable in combat. Boeing believes software refinements, and not a design overhaul, can solve most of the issues. As of 2021, the KC-46 has four remaining category 1 deficiencies: two involving the Remote Vision System that are expected to be resolved when a new version of the system is rolled out in 2023; a problem with the stiffness of the air refueling boom that keeps it from being able to refuel some of the planes in the service’s inventory; and an issue with fuel leaks (fucking fuel leaks in a tanker, are you serious!?). Although issues with the boom may be on the Air Force's dime. \n",

      "* Pentagon and Military Branch officials/management have issues with BA's shoddy military products. \n",

However, until BA can show better strength via contract awards in size and number and novel designs, I do not consider them a good play for the Aerospace Sector in regards to defense spending--not even as a value play--furthermore, I don't even consider BA a buy when factoring in their commercial business.

After HOURS of going back and forth on hold, they ask why money was sent to the account from someone else (nothing like this ever happened). They then ask other questions that further led me to believe they had no idea what they were talking about. I tell them they are the worst brokerage firm I've ever dealt with, and the cunts actually refuse to wire my money to my bank. They delay (intentionally I'm sure) and eventually agree only to do an ACH transfer (will take a week) despite the fact they do wire transfers all the damn time. 3 of the 4 people I spoke to were absolute beligerent and argumentative cunts, and it seemed they had no idea what was actually going on.

They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference.

      "What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD.

      "\n",
      "The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.\n",

      "I want to bring your attention to Vivint Smart Home ($VVNT).  The stock has been getting absolutely hammered year-to-date (around -50%) because it was spun out of a former SPAC, and everyone is selling SPACs now.  While some SPACs (and resultant companies) are insanely stupid, this one is not. It now trades at $10.77 per share, which is barely off the price it listed at last year ($10, or 7.75x Adj. CY20 EV/EBITDA).  I think fair value today is more like $25 (10x Adj. CY22 EV/EBITDA), and has the potential to double or triple that over the next few years.  The cap is small ($2.5bn), the float is extremely low (20% of total), and short interest is around 5% (11 days to cover), meaning when the stock moves, the stock moves big.\n",

      "**Background and Market Overview:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint Smart Home is a player in the smart home industry.  They earn money on subscriptions (recurring revenue!) and equipment sales.  You may have seen one of their recent commercials with Snoop Dogg ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTnFHCNLrAE)).  It’s one of the most respected players in the industry, and is differentiated by handling the whole stack themselves (installation, technology, maintenance/services, etc., like an Apple product for smart homes).  In terms of competition, there isn’t anyone else that provides full-service, do-it-for-me (DIFM) installation for smart home technologies.  They obviously compete with DIY suppliers (Amazon, Google, Alarm.com), but in all likelihood market will move towards DIFM as the preferred solution as the technology becomes more complex and integrated. Other traditional security vendors are trying to break into the space (think ADT, which partnered with Google recently), but their solutions don’t appear to be as fully-integrated and comprehensive as Vivint’s.  This is an attractive market that Vivint has first-mover advantage in, and that is likely to take off over the next decade as IoT adoption accelerates.\n",

      "\n",
      "**The 2020 SPAC and Solvency Risk:**\n",
      "\n",
      "When the company de-SPAC’d in 2020, nobody had any clue if their business model transition would allow them to be solvent.  The company had been bleeding cash for years because they used to finance the smart home equipment themselves (and therefore had to raise debt on their own balance sheet).  In 2017-2018, with the help of Blackstone as their PE sponsor, they made a transition to allow the consumer to finance the equipment sale, and the financing company would give them the cash upfront.  Ever since, the company has been beating and generating lots of cash flow every quarter.  Solvency is no longer an issue.  I repeat, despite the negative shareholder’s equity (which Buffett admits is not that important), this company is no longer a going concern!\n",
      "\n",
      "How the New Operating Model Revitalized its Unit Economics: The other concern regarding Vivint was that its operating model was just not that attractive.  At the time, subscriber acquisition costs (SAC) were way too high (due in large part because they had to finance the equipment for them).  So even though lifetime value (LTV) looked attractive, LTV/SAC looked weak.  Over the course of 2020, we saw the success of their new business model:  SAC per new subscriber fell -86%, from $1018 to $139!  Subscriber growth is now meaningfully accretive to the business.\n",

      "**Isn’t the Smart Home Market Mature?** \n",
      "\n",
      "The home security market definitely is.  ADT hasn’t seen net subscriber growth in years.  It probably matured at around 25% penetration.  But what simpletons don’t realize is that security is just one vertical in the smart home market, which will all be consolidated into players like Vivint.  The smart home market is expected to grow almost 13% CAGR through 2025 to reach $47bn in the US.  And this company has only $1.3bn in revenue and 1.8mm subscribers!  Very underpenetrated.  And the CEO thinks household penetration can reach upwards of 80% over the next 5-10 years.  So we’re in the early innings.  After all, Vivint’s subscriber base has been growing high single digits for many years now, and next-year guidance reaffirms that this trend should remain in place. They are building the brand and they are growing.  And yet the company trades on the same multiple as ADT (which isn’t growing at all!) and Verizon/AT&T (which are also barely growing, and are exposed to a mature market with extreme competition).\n",

And similarly, Vivint is a prime candidate to enter the ageing-in-place market (i.e. smart home for old people who need monitoring).  While the insurance vertical is probably not too far away, there has been no commentary on when ageing-in-place business might take off.  But either way, the market currently gives no credit to Vivint for these potential adjacencies.  Big revenue and TAM expansion opportunities!\n",

But lockups expired a long time ago and Blackstone is holding on.  Some of the other venture funds have all reduced their positions now.  In addition, management has been buying in.  The negative shareholder’s equity and leverage are concerns, but given their new ability to generate and scale free cash flow, Vivint should have no trouble balancing investment and paying debt down.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for \"rewiring\" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's \"This is Life\" series called \"Psychedelic Healing\" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.\n",

      "**MindMed DD --> Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**\n",

This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O’Leary (yes, Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.\n",
      "\n",
      "*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "*As an investor in a sector that is \"breakthrough\" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.\n",

      "If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.\n",
      "2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Metrics:** \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).\n",
      "2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)\n",
      "3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. \n",
      "4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.\n",
      "5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is \"an institution.\" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. \n",
      "\n",
      "**So what's the catch?**\n",
      "Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: \n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.\n",
      "2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation.\n",

      "* **Profitable** \\- For the full-year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/#:~:text=For%20the%20full%2Dyear%20of,up%20a%20record%2Dsetting%20year))\n",
      "* **Special dividend** \\- RKT issued a special dividend of $1.11, roughly 4.5%, only 7 months after IPO on 3/8/2021. That's a ballsy move and shows they got money to spare\n",
      "* **Buyback** \\- RKT also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program back on 11/10/2020 ([source](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/11/10/quicken-loans-rocket-companies-third-quarter-profits-buyback/6239432002/)). We don't know when or if it's been deployed yet, but again it shows an insane amount of confidence in your cash flow to do something only 3 months after IPO\n",
      "* **Advertising** \\- RKT has also started investing heavily in sponsorships and advertising, again to appeal to millenials. They sponsored the [Super Bowl](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2021/01/07/rocket-mortgage-super-bowl-squares-sweepstakes-returns-for-super-bowl-lv-after-awarding-1-75-million-in-last-years-big-game/) with a contest and commercials, an [Indy 500](https://racer.com/2021/04/01/paretta-lands-rocket-pro-tpo-backing-for-indy-500/) car, and also sponsored the [100 Thieves League of Legends Training Room](https://youtu.be/h4SMSCKOXO8?t=59) for some fucking reason. I think they're just flexing at this point\n",

Credit to [u/amru\\_ons](https://www.reddit.com/user/amru_ons/) for the find. Carvana is currently worth 49.16B which is MORE than RKT at 44.55B which boggles my mind.\n",

      "* **Wat about mah short squeeze?!?!** Sadly, I do believe the squeeze has already been squoze and sadly it was only a 1-day affair.

This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and rapidly decreasing grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below.\n",

Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short.

      "* **CBS Entertainment Group** consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television and CBS Television Stations. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\n",
      "* **Domestic Media Networks** encompasses the pay television channels owned by ViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy  Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix.      ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels  listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.\n",
      "* **International Networks** encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in  Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in  Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18. This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.\n",
      "* **Streaming Group** focused on the global over-the-top streaming services and Internet properties. This division encompasses **Paramount+, Pluto TV, CBSN, CBS Sports HQ, BET+ and Noggin**.\n",
      "* **Global Distribution Group** focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Leadership***\n",
      "\n",
      "ViacomCBS is headed by Robert Bakish.  Bakish holds a Bachelor of Science in operations research from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and also earned an MBA from Columbia Business School. He has been with Viacom (per-merger enitiy) since February 1997, joining initially as Vice President of Planning and Development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Head of international operations:** In January 2007 Bakish became President of MTV Networks International (MTVNI), overseeing all MTV Networks operations outside the U.S. He immediately restructured MTVNI, cutting 8% of the workforce in addition to merging some overseas units with the UK business and devolving responsibilities for Latin American operations to new offices across the region. He launched the popular Colors franchise of networks via the Viacom18 joint venture in the high-growth market of India. MTVNI had double-digit, year-on-year growth during his tenure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CEO:** In January 2011, Bakish was promoted to the newly created position of President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN). During his tenure, Bakish expanded Viacom's international footprint, and VIMN was Viacom's most successful division; revenue doubled, and VIMN grew to more than 200 television channels. Under his leadership, the Paramount Channel was launched, offering movies and television shows in Europe, Latin America and Russia. He oversaw the expansion of networks such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Spike to an increasing number of foreign markets, and helped orchestrate the acquisition of Channel 5 in the UK and Telefe in Argentina. He also oversaw the launch of apps, including the Viacom Play Plex suite of branded mobile TV apps and the BET Play direct-to-consumer subscription video-on-demand app for an adult audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2016, Bakish was named acting President and CEO of Viacom effective November 15, replacing interim CEO Tom Dooley. Simultaneously, he was also appointed President and CEO of the newly created Viacom Global Entertainment Group, combining Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) with Viacom's Music and Entertainment group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike TV and Logo TV; two additional networks, TV Land and CMT, also joined the Global Entertainment Group. Optimistic that Bakish could make good on his plans to turn Viacom's core U.S. cable networks and its Paramount Pictures film studio around, the board of directors of Viacom Inc. made Bakish's appointment as President and CEO permanent on December 12, 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early 2017, **Bakish laid out a five-point plan to turn Viacom around and return the company to steady profitability**. This consisted of focusing on Viacom's six flagship brands: BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount; revitalizing content and talent; deepening distributor and advertiser partnerships to **drive traditional revenue; increasing digital offerings, consumer products and live experiences; and optimizing and energizing the organization**. The strategy also included having Paramount Pictures develop films and franchises connected to Viacom television content; additionally, Spike TV would be rebranded as and converted to a broad-based general entertainment channel, the Paramount Network, in early 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the fall of 2017 Bakish had restructured Viacom, replacing executives at nearly every company, including hiring Jim Gianopulos - formerly chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox, as the new chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In 2018, Bakish's implementation of his five-point comprehensive strategy was credited with Viacom's much improved finances and improved company morale and focus**. In 2018, under Bakish's direction and in accordance with his plan to capture younger and digital markets, Viacom acquired digital platform WhoSay, internet video conference VidCon, and online television network AwesomenessTV. In early 2018, Bakish also announced the launch of an official Viacom streaming service, which will support ads and will include series and content from Viacom that hasn't been available on other streaming services. In April 2018, Viacom launched Viacom Digital Studios, which will create new original content hosted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. In addition, later that June, Bakish announced that Viacom will produce some new series exclusively for Netflix, beginning with Nickelodeon related content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post merger, Bakish swiftly started streamlining and managing operating costs, especially during the pandemic. In May 2020, ViacomCBS initiated a round of post-merger layoffs across all parts of the company but primarily hitting divisions within the CBS Entertainment Group. The was part of a restructuring of various operations at CBS as part of the integration with Viacom, as well as nod to changes in the business including those related to COVID. Bakish has targeted $750 million in synergies from the combination and the company said it had eliminated 450 positions. That has risen as the year progressed. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already in a period of significant change to integrate our newly combined company – work that is helping us weather this crisis, creatively adapt and strengthen the resiliency of our business,” Bakish wrote. “It’s critical that we continue these efforts to integrate and evolve ViacomCBS to remain competitive now and for the future\\*\\*.  This means continuing to integrate and streamline our operations, manage our costs as diligently as we can, and follow through on our committed post-merger synergy targets.\\*\\*”\n",

      "As noted above, one of the largest pay-TV service providers with a diverse portfolio of network subsidiaries, broadcast rights, and content library for all audience demographics. VIAC generates 37% of its Revenue from CBS (primarily CBS and CW Broadcast stations), 34% from Cable Networks (Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV), 11% from Paramount (movie and TV studio), 8% from Showtime, and 7% from Local Media (Owned and Operated affiliates). In terms of the type of revenue, 40% is advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.\n",

      "\n",
      "Streaming services are the key growth driver for VIAC. Although, the thesis isn't based on VIAC becoming a streaming powerhouse it's important to discuss where they can easily derive growth to exceed expectations. Currently, they operate two platforms PlutoTV and Paramount+. PlutoTV is a free ad-supported streaming TV service. It currently has 43M monthly active users with a management target of 100-120M by 2024. Paramount+ is a more standard streaming platform ($4.99 for ad-supported and $9.99 for premium). It leverages VIAC's deep content library, news subsidiaries, and is differentiated in its offerings of live sports Overall, streaming revenue is $2.6bn with a management target of $7bn by 2024 with 30M current subscribers and management targets of 65-75M subscribers by 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paramount+ has a very attractive kid-focused value proposition. This [article](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/) discusses the most popular kids' shows in 2021 and the top two are unsurprisingly **Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants which are both owned by VIAC.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, there is a differentiated live sports offering with VIAC having signed contracts with numerous major sporting events to be hosted on Paramount+. The service will feature **over 1,000 live sporting events per year**, including regular-season games, playoffs, championships and more across the following marquee properties: *The NFL on CBS,* The Masters, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, PGA TOUR and Championship, *SEC on CBS,* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. **Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.**\n",

      "\n",
      "VIAC has great streaming potential with significant differentiating features and **currently the market is not pricing in this potential growth.**\n",
      "\n",
      "VIAC is unique in operating one of four broadcast networks in the United States. This market position enables broad distribution and large/well-diversified audience demographics. While \"cord-cutting\" is a key structural challenge, this business generates cash that can be deployed into growth businesses. **Secondly, the return of the theatrical business will serve as another source of both content and cash generation for VIAC as they continue to reposition their portfolio around streaming.**\n",
      "\n",
      "***Non-core assets***\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-core assets being sold is another potential source of significant cash. Some would be sale of CBS' headquarter building (\\~$1bn), Simon & Schuster (sold for $2.2bn, expected to close in 2021), and CNET $500mn. **All combined this could potentially raise $3.0-3.5bn in cash.**\n",

      "As you all probably know by now, our boy Billy Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns, but not the actual ownership, of the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22, ViacomCBS announced plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal that generated $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans (a very preudent decision by management considering the stock price at the time). Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. Below are the main points of what happened after:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Archegos  was hit with a margin call.\n",
      "2. Archegos  defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund\n",

      "4. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total      return swap\n",

For Paramount+ and Pluto TV to achieve the expected success, ViacomCBS will have to invest substantial amounts in producing high-quality original content and also on securing broadcast rights to live sports events, and it makes sense for the company to raise funds when there is an opportunity in the market.

      "Streaming is one of the most competitive, yet fast-growing business segments in the world today. A closer look at recent developments in the industry reveals the presence of a loyal follower base for a brand will not lead to immediate success in the OTT industry. For instance, Apple is struggling to gain market share in the OTT streaming industry although it has a wide follower base and a second-to-none brand value. In contrast, The Walt Disney Company has seen unimaginable success with Disney+. The differentiator is the expertise in content creation and the availability of marketing channels to take the streaming service in front of consumers who are likely to subscribe to a premium subscription service.\n",

      "ViacomCBS is one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the world, and the company owns some of the most widely followed TV shows and networks. For example, MTV is considered a leading media brand that interacts with the younger population and has a reach of 450 million households in 180 countries. Nickelodeon is another media asset owned by ViacomCBS which has a massive reach.

      "One of the major hurdles to success faced by the subscription-based OTT content streaming industry in emerging markets is the unwillingness of many consumers to pay a monthly fee to watch premium content. This has a lot to do with the median income levels as well. Because of this characteristic, the illegal pirate video services industry continues to thrive in high-growth regions such as Brazil, India, and many other Asian and Latin American nations. According to a recent study by Mint, India's OTT industry loses up to 30% of revenue to pirate video service providers. Pluto TV is primed for growth in international markets because of its ad-supported model as a result of the favorable demographics for this industry in emerging markets, which will be a catalyst for ViacomCBS's growth in the coming years.\n",

      "Considering the growth opportunities available in the streaming industry, I believe the company management is correct in raising funds to meet the content investment requirements. As the streaming services gain traction, I am confident of a significant expansion in valuation multiples similar to what happened with Disney stock. As long as Disney remained a traditional media company, the company's shares traded at reasonable valuation multiples. However, the decision to restructure the business last October in a bid to prioritize Disney+ sent the stock soaring to new highs because of the positive sentiment of investors toward the OTT streaming industry. In the coming months, I expect a similar expansion in valuation multiples for ViacomCBS stock as well, along with the steady progress the company is expected to make in prioritizing the direct-to-consumer business.\n",

      "Meanwhile, Pluto TV – which Viacom acquired in early 2019 for $340 million – clinched 43 million global monthly active users and 30.1 million domestic MAUs. **Pluto TV also closed new global distribution agreements with Samsung and Google.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Global streaming and digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888 million in Q4, driven by 74% growth in streaming subscription revenue and 69% streaming advertising revenue growth.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total revenue increased 3% YoY to $6.8 billion in Q4 and the company took in $1.08 billion in operating income. Advertising revenue increased 4% YoY to $3.1 billion in the quarter, mainly due to the growth of streaming and political advertising in Q4.**\n",

      "Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra said ViacomCBS ended 2020 with $2.6 billion in global streaming subscription and advertising revenue – **with an annual run rate of $3.6 billion – exceeding the company’s expectations.** He added that ViacomCBS has a goal of reaching 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers – mainly through Paramount Plus – and more than $7 billion in streaming revenue by 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The new service includes more than 30,000 TV episodes and films such as “The Godfather” and “The Brady Bunch” as well as content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and the Smithsonian Channel.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Paramount Plus will also debut original movies, series and documentaries, and ViacomCBS is investing aggressively in content to support the growth of its streaming services. ViacomCBS invested $15 billion on content last year, and streaming content expenses will increase to at least $5 billion by 2024**.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We came up with the pricing strategy because we wanted to serve the greatest addressable audience – which we thing the two tiers does,” said Tom Ryan, president and CEO of streaming at ViacomCBS, who also co-founded Pluto TV. “Also, the two-tiers allow us to drive both subscription and advertising revenue. The $4.99 tier gives us greater flexibility in how we go to market with distribution partners.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That lower tier still has a lot more content than CBS All Access had. The $9.99 plan has no ads and also has more live sports – including NFL football, the UEFA Champions League, PGA Tour and more – and breaking news, **both of which the execs said is rare in streaming.**\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right now, we think those are the best price points to go to market with and they’re clearly very competitive in each of their respective lanes,” Ryan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike HBO Max, which announced in December that it would release its slate of films simultaneously in theaters and streaming, ViacomCBS said it is committed to the theatrical experience, though the typical 90-day window before a theatrical release is available to buy or rent will be much shorter. **Major films such as “A Quiet Place Part 2” and “Mission Impossible 7” will be available on Paramount Plus 45 days after hitting theaters.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also remains committed to free ad-supported TV. **Pluto TV is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business and is the top free ad-supported streaming service in the United States with the largest distribution footprint in AVOD.** By the end of 2024, Pluto TV is expected to have between 100 million and 120 million monthly active users globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pluto TV hasn’t just proven our skeptics wrong, we pioneered a new category and now we’re one of the free leading television services,” Ryan said. “Our ad partners love Pluto because we offer the best of both worlds – the efficient targeting of digital with the brand building and storytelling of traditional TV.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pluto TV helps create a “super funnel” that expands the company’s paid services, Ryan said, in part by featuring pilot episodes or past seasons of a show before a new season airs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**“Once they’re hooked, we offer a trial subscription for more,” he said. “With Pluto’s free linear experience, we can effortlessly introduce tens of millions of viewers to the amazing content we’ve highlighted.”**\n",

      "“Last year, ViacomCBS made $1.891 billion in free cash flow (FCF), according to the company’s earnings release. However, that included a large negative FCF result of -$453 million for Q4 2020. That implies that the FCF for the first 9 months of 2020 was $2.344 billion.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, this must be a seasonal thing about negative FCF during Q4. In fact, looking at the numbers for Q4 2020 even more closely, it included a total of $388 million in one-time losses on sales of assets. That would have come close to covering most of the -$453 million in FCF during Q4 2020. **This is another reason why I believe that Q1 will show a major turnaround in free cash flow**.”\n",

Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.\n",

      "1. The cost of PACB’s method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method. And much faster. (It should be noted that although the Saphyr can seemingly detect all that NGS & LRS can but at a lower cost, it is not actually the full case. Basically, saphyr can detect certain parts at a higher efficiency but not everything. Most NGS & LRS provide higher-resolution base-level nucleotide information. Saphyr’s map provides a structural map, and does not directly identify the chemistry comprising the structure. Very roughly like if you assay a house, the optical map would be great for showing you the shapes of the foundation, wall and roof framing, but it wouldn't tell you the materials. For similar esoteric information ((intro to ogm & how saphyr works, what it does)) that will help in illuminating the basic process of OGM in action vs. LRS or NGS, these two sources might be good starting places.

DNA replication is a fundamental process of cell growth seen in cancer and was not easy to study in human genomes. Through Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr-based method, the timing, speed, and origin of DNA replication will be known in human cells at a coverage level, which is thousands of times higher than earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing. The body of humans and other organisms develops and grows when cells divide, and for each division, the entire genome needs to be replicated, the company said.

      "Here’s something interesting to consider from a more technical options standpoint: right now there is unusually high open interest in CLOV calls (a significant portion being out of the money). These calls are often written by market makers, who need to hedge their short calls by purchasing stock. As you know, gamma squeezes occur as the stock rises and more of these call options go in the money and the whales buy up stock to hedge their risk. Here is another part of the puzzle many people are missing: the amount of stock they buy to hedge is often related to the delta of the option (so they can remain delta neutral). Hence, the higher the delta of a contract, the more shares the market maker needs to buy in order to hedge the risk. Here’s another fact: vanna (the second order Greek, measuring delta sensitivity with respect to implied volatility) is (typically) positive. This means that if implied volatility goes up, delta will go up, and market makers will have to purchase more shares to remain market neutral. Now here’s the kicker: as earnings approach, implied volatility will usually, particularly in shorter term contracts, skyrocket. Couple this with the fact that the May 21 expiration is very close to earnings, deltas across the board will quite possibly rise substantially in the days before earnings, forcing market makers to buy up huge chunks of stock to hedge, and hence potentially driving up the price by a tremendous deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all speculation. I cannot stress enough that there is no guarantee that this is the case. This theory could fail for a number of reasons: these calls may simply be retail investors who aren’t bound by any delta neutral strategies or anything of the sort; the stock may drop before earnings and hence the increase in implied volatility could fail to offset the change in underlying's effect on delta; the market makers simply buy the calls back at a premium from paper-handed option buyers, taking a loss; or there is sufficient downward pressure/selling momentum at the time that the market makers could simply buy a lot of stock without drastically increasing the price. That's why I need to say: please please please only invest if you genuinely believe in the stock and can afford to lose whatever you put in. The stock market is risky business - nothing is guaranteed and you can always lose a lot of money if you make poor decisions. In fact, you can lose a lot of money even if you make really good decisions and the market turns against you.\n",

However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.\n",

That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.\n",

Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**\n",

      "Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.\n",

We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.\n",

At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength.

      "On the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn’t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn’t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don’t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless \"function-as-a-service\" can provide that capacity for a developer.\n",

This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report. Those things need to just check out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n",
      "\n",
      ">If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.\n",

      "Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).\n",

      "\n",
      "As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \\~2X and two-year returns were \\~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark.  \n",

      "\n",
      "But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations.

      "\n",
      ">We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.\n",

      " The current economic data being released combined with recent statements from large corporations about pricing should be ringing inflation alarm bells. It’s not just meme stocks that are mooning, the price of everything is going thru the roof. Could it be that the inevitable hangover from the money printer going BRRRRR is approaching? I have no idea, but the numbers are staggering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look past the bullshit CPI which registered 2.6% for the March reading. The everyday items you and I consume are going up by much larger amounts than the FEDs favorite inflation gauge. Take housing prices for example, which everyone knows are going up at a crazy rate. February year over year increase was 12% nationally and shows no sign of slowing down. In my area, houses are selling in days at 20-25% over list. But the CPI doesn’t reflect this. The CPI tries to estimate housing inflation using “owner equivalent rent” which is what a homeowner would pay to rent their own house. The cost of the house is ignored in this equation, the focus being on the cost of the shelter it provides instead. That’s great, unless you want to buy a house. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prices of just about everything that it takes to build that house are going up too. The price of a new lot to build on is up 11% YOY and will likely continue to climb as supply of new lots is down 20% in that same period. The materials that make up the home are up as follows:\n",
      "\n",

      "Add in a shortage of construction workers, a national push for higher wages and ultra-low interest rates and housing shows no signs of becoming more affordable anytime soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fulfilment costs are going up across the board as well, due to numerous factors. Disruptions in the global shipping markets have led to price increases of 25-50% on shipping containers. A shortage of U.S. truck drivers will also lead to higher shipping costs, as well as having the add on affect of raising the cost of gas. Typically, 10% of U.S. tanker capacity is idle, currently it is 20-25% idle due to the shortage. Summer driving season is approaching. This may cause a feedback loop of higher gas prices as supply struggles to keep up with demand, negatively impacting consumers and businesses alike. \n",
      "\n",
      "To compound the aforementioned issues, the prices of the commodities and inputs used to produce a broad range of goods are also increasing rapidly. Look at these increases in just the last month alone:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cocoa: +2.5%\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee: +12.7%\n",

      "\n",
      "Wheat: +18%\n",
      "\n",
      "Corn: +18.5%\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmers are now substituting wheat grown for human consumption as animal feed due to the huge increase in the price of corn. This feedstock inflation can trickle thru the butcher block and dairy isle and potentially increase prices of meat, chicken, milk, eggs and cheese, just to name a few. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the recent earnings calls of several multi-national corporations the topic of pricing and supply chain issues was highlighted. Coke and Pepsi are both going to raise prices, and if you look at the price of sugar, the reason is obvious. P&G and Mondelez both announced intentions to do the same, and Kraft spoke about rising costs across it supply chains. Selling a smaller amount for the same price isn’t gonna cut it this time anymore. Prices are going up. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, inflation appears to be working its way thru commodities markets and supply chains and will soon be knocking on the door. Printer’s days of going BRRRR may be catching up with us. Don’t worry though, you likely won’t be affected. Unless you live inside, drive, eat, drink coffee or pop, shop online or have anything to do with those industries, you’ll be just fine!\n",

Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).\n",

      "Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of \"taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site\" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.\n",

Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).\n",

I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.

      "I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company \"Same Ole Shit\" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.\n",

Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.\n",

Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.\n",

The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the \"who are these  people\" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.

July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.\n",

      "Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.\n",

I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.

Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.

      "\n",
      "Some takeaway from the interview:\n",
      "\n",
      "“So big debut on the NASDAQ today, but I'm looking at the stock and it's down 26%. So take us through what's going in your mind right now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "JR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we're going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn't just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?\n",
      "\n",
      "And how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we're not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mentioned your investor base-- you've got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you're also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what's your take on what you're seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "JR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We're very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there's been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets.

The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.\n",

      "I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n",
      "\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "With AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n",

      "\n",
      "I thought I’d post about my thoughts on MNMD. First of all, please do your own due diligence and do not fall victim to the pump, hype and euphoria. These are highly speculative investments and have significant risk associated. All that said, there have been many requests for fundamental analysis and MNMD projections so I wanted to provide my thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*All figures in USD (market cap, sales) except for my investment holdings. I purchased MMED.NE shares. Source data available as well, but got messy with all the 10-k filings and links in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Entry Point\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, I want to address the most commonly raised question on this thread: “Is it too late to buy MNMD?” Any investment is subject to the risk / reward paradigm. Those that got in at $0.3 deserve every penny they earned as MNMD was by definition a penny stock and one of the most risky investments you could own. Since then, it has grown tremendously due to scientific milestones which have pointed to significant progress in the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The milestones MNMD has achieved have DERISKED MNMD from a penny stock to a small cap biotech company with a very large drug portfolio and numerous future catalysts. I do not expect to make 10x my investment in a week, nor should you. Is there still tremendous upside even at the current valuation of \\~$1.5bn? I strongly believe so and will let my position reinforce that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered this space with an average cost of \\~$4.9 CAD, holding 311,206 shares, and a book value of \\~1.5MM. Yes you read that correctly. Do I panic every day and check the ticker? No. Does my heart beat thinking of the time I evaporated \\~$500,000 in unrealized loss when the stock was at $3.4? No. In fact, I continue to pick up shares at what I believe is a discounted valuation. There will be many that look at $4.9 entry point and think that even I got in at the bottom. It’s all relative.\n",
      "\n",
      "[OPs original YOLO \\(Not a YOLO\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m5g55vw3dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=463e90c35b488f6a370a63769daece2d5a07f5d8)\n",
      "\n",
      "I only invested what I could afford to lose and although $1.5MM is a large sum of money, it is not my entire portfolio, nor would it impact my daily life. If I lost it all it would not impact my ability to service my mortgage, pay my bills, impact my other investments, nor prohibit me from doing the things I love. I continue to hold dry powder and monitor my investment on a monthly basis, while continuing to buy following successful milestones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very long term play that could fundamentally change the way we treat the body’s most important organ. We are just getting started. I have a very strong conviction on the future outcome of this industry and that is the reason I couldn’t be bothered about short term fluctuations. An important question to ask yourself is whether you believe MNMD can reach its next scientific milestone. Take things one step at a time and is there a probability the next scientific update will be positive? Emphasis on science, ignoring NASDAQ, candlesticks, and capital structure (for now).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Institutional Capital\n",
      "\n",
      "I work in finance (albeit project finance / private equity, and don’t value stocks for a living, so don’t consider me an expert here) but already know of a few moderately capitalized asset managers that are now participating in MNMD. The recent bought deals are evidence of sophisticated capital flowing into this industry. I personally qualify as an ‘accredited investor’ and am having conversations constantly with folks in my circles who are investing heavily into these stocks. As more institutional capital flows in, the more stable these stocks become. Of course, this is all relative.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Access to liquidity\n",
      "\n",
      "As with all brand new industries, the capital requirement is immense in order to bring products to market. What drew me into the space was the fact that MNMD did raise capital. Biotech stocks do not have cashflow, thus their only path to fund operations is through equity raises. The fact that MNMD was able to raise over $237MM CAD since May 2019 is a positive for this company. Yes it is dilutive, and good job for paying attention in finance 101 class, but bootstrapping a biotech company is not possible, nor is servicing debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path to commercialization of will be full of obstacles, however a strong balance sheet with sufficient capital gives MNMD the resources to get there. The current valuation has tremendous upside following scientific milestones and future equity raises and dilutions are a good thing, as it will be at an increased valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are definitely smaller cap companies out there that may double overnight, however for the risk / reward, I do not feel comfortable owning companies that don’t have a large balance sheet, nor a diversified drug portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Believe in the Science\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not feel I am in a position to write original content on the efficacy of these drugs. I have done my research and read a fair number of published studies but anything that I write would simply be regurgitating what others have said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest investors in this space are those with personal experiences with psychedelics because you have first-hand experience of the profound meaning extracted from one treatment. The ability to dissolve your ego enables you to deal with the root cause of so many problems ranging from depression, PTSD and addition, without approaching the problem by numbing symptoms. Herein lies the inherent value of this industry and will simply take time to prove it through trails. I have the conviction to continue to invest because I believe in the science. The data to reinforce this is on its way, and I personally want to invest now, knowing that the likelihood of very significant catalysts are probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Forecasts\n",
      "\n",
      "This of course is the elephant in the room for early investors, later\\[er\\] investors and bears alike. Is a $1.5bn market cap pricing in all of the upside already? Is this a $100bn stock? This company has zero revenues, shouldn’t it be worth zero?\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, no one knows. There is tremendous risk with this company. However, I will not be selling unless we see some significant negative scientific outcomes. Again, less emphasis on stock price, NASDAQ, more emphasis on the science. Everything else will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The various ways to value a company (DCF, sales / earnings multiples, liquidation value etc) all have their issues with an early stage company of this nature. Any sort of bottoms up DCF analysis is just guessing because variables such as patient count, dosage, pricing, market share, market penetration, amongst other have far too much variation to come up with a reliable figure. Discount rates and time horizon can favour your outcome depending on how aggressive / conservative you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the way I like to look at this market is a best case scenario for a single drug, based off historical sales data from one company and one drug. This implicitly takes into account patient dosage, competition, market share, market penetration etc, because one drug from one company has already proven its ability to capture such sales data.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Letters and Numbers](https://preview.redd.it/37z2u5a9dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a0b8a6b8643b49666b9eef994eb70c4984f64dd)\n",
      "\n",
      "I have broken out annual sales data for various comparable drugs according to MNMD’s current pipeline offering. This is the inherent benefit of MNMD, is that it has a diverse portfolio covering many underserved issues. Like many of you, I believe MNMD’s biggest blockbuster will be Layla, given the problem of Opioid addition plus MNMD’s IP rights on 18-MC to corner sales. Suboxone is the current drug on the market due to delayed onset effects ranging from 24-36 hours, compared to someone in withdrawal uses fast acting opioids 3-4 times a day. Suboxone itself however is still addictive and has a long list of negative side effects. Furthermore, it does not correct dopamine dysregulation in patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sales of Suboxone alone are growing at an \\~9% CAGR, with sales expected to reach \\~$4bn in 2028.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use case for 18-MC however, does not stop at Opioid addiction, and can be applied to alcohol dependency and smoking dependency among others. This means the TAM for 18-MC could be significantly larger than the existing market captured by Suboxone given its smaller demographics relative to 18-MC. Could Layla exhibit sales greater than Suboxone one day? Who knows. Sticking with comp sales for the analysis for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various anxiety, depression and ADHD medication is also shown in the table to show sales potential of Lucy, Albert and the micro dose programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a possibility of a LSD, 18-MC, or LSD compound or derivative achieving blockbuster drug status? Do you think there is an inherent benefit to a psychedelic compared to an antidepressant sedative with side effects such as nausea, weight gain etc?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your perceived probability and sales outcomes depends on whether you believe in the science. Those that don’t can easily be skeptical of a $1.5bn market cap many years away from profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those that do, look at the next half a dozen clinical trial outcomes as very probable and thus have applied a less punitive discount to the stock valuation. I have rationalized my decision to invest at $1.5MM because of my own perceived discount rate and confidence in the next 12 months of positive catalysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Valuation Multiples\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as many of you know, investors pay a multiple for the future earnings of a company, today. If a drug makes $1bn annually, investors will pay a multiple of future earnings expected over the drugs lifetime, discounted by various factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various metrics to use here, ranging from Enterprise Value / Sales or various types of earnings metrics. MNMD is years away from having a real operating company, anything to sell, or even the corporate infrastructure to get it to market. However, the question has always been, how big do you think this company could get?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where things can get tricky. We used peak annual sales in the last section to forecast comparable estimates for MNMD revenues. Thus, I believe it is appropriate to use mature, large cap trading multiples instead of early stage bio techs, as our revenue estimates were mature figures with stabilized growth. If we were to use companies / drugs earlier in their lifecycle or clinical phases, the trading multiples would be much higher because the market is buying potential future sales. Can’t have it both ways.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "All of the chart data in the graph is specific to the pharma industry. However, there are various subsectors to the industry such as Contract Development Manufacturing and Contract Research Organization. MNMD would likely have to partner with each of these types of firms to scale its business, better assess market size etc, but wouldn’t trade at similar multiples given a different business model. Same goes for Packaging and Distribution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although the chart gives a good reference point for pharma multiples, I wanted to look at valuation from a more company specific perspective. The chart above shows large cap specialty pharma companies that are publicly traded. This will give you an approximate median value of what the market is willing to pay for a company that has a certain amount of sales. As you can see in the green box, industry multiples of EV/EBIITDA or EV/Sales will basically get you to the same place. Median pharma industry EBITDA margins are in the 40% range with EV/Sales at \\~4x vs EV/EBITDA of 10x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the above list of trading comps is stale data, as of Sept ’19. I only want to use public data and have refrained from using Bloomberg, Cap IQ etc. Thus the information I’m posting is merely reposts of info available on Google. As you can see, Allergan is listed in this table as a live trading comp, and has since been acquired by AbbVie. Accordingly, I want to highlight some notable M+A activity:\n",
      "\n",
      "Amgen acquires Celgne’s plaque psoriasis drug, Otezla $13.4bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.6x Thermo Fisher acquires Qiagen for $11.5bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.3x Abbvie acquires Allergan for $84.2bn: EV / LTM Sales = 5.4x Elanco acquires Bayer’s animal health unit for $7.6bn: EV / LTM Sales = 4.5x As you can see, companies are willing to pay a premium in M&A to acquire competitors and drugs, due to synergies, reduction in SG&A etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very long winded way of showing that if one of MNMD’s compounds hits, and exhibits sales in line with any sort of comparable drug from the table above, this could be a $20-30 billion dollar company (\\~4bn\\*5-7x). If several of these drugs reach commercialization, this is potentially a $100 billion dollar company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I agree that these projections are completely outlandish right now. I’m simply doing the exercise you all wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to guess at your own forecast sales and multiply out enterprise value using the above metrics. Before you rip me apart for the extreme optimism, I understand that I’m using multiples for stable, reputable, large cap pharma. I understand that there is an extreme amount of stigma attached to psychedelics and achieving ubiquity for these treatments is a large uphill battle. There is an enormous amount of work, luck and time from now until sales and this is not to be under estimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Do I think MNMD is worth $30-$100bn today? No.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Do I think MNMD is worth somewhere in between today’s valuation and $30-$100bn?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Depends **whether you believe in the science.** If you’re reading this, odds are you do. I invested because I believe it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So instead, let’s take a lazy man’s approach to valuation and take things one step at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Simpler Approach to Valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "The exercise above is to show you all the immense potential of MMED’Fs drug portfolio. Do I think MNMD is the next Pfizer, Abbie Vie or Eli Lilly? No. This is not a $500bn dollar company. However, I do genuinely think there is tremendous upside not factored into the pricing for this stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental analysis aside, I think the simplest way to approach valuation is from a catalyst + efficient market hypothesis perspective. Markets are not fully efficient, nor even semi-efficient, but there is some sort of reasoning in believing what the market is willing to pay. The obvious flaws in this are that the market right is riddled with irrational investors and a market of 300m financially illiterate traders isn’t more efficient than an illiquid market of 10 rational ones. As of today’s post there is a discount to the $4.40 price. To me, that’s just more opportunity to continue to scoop up more shares.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alright boys, disruptive tech has been hit hard, so buy the fucking dip and either go broke or get rich with me (thanks be to Jpow). I think ROOT is a solid disruptive tech play that will hit so hard it may even make the fact that people buy 10-year treasury bills at these yields in the face of inflation make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT is an insurance tech (or insurtech) company, which is considered the \"next big opportunity after FinTech,\" as the insurance industry is considered to be at a \"key inflection point\" in a pivot to insurance tech companies ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005415/en/Global-Insurtech-Market-2020-to-2025---Growth-Trends-and-Forecast---ResearchAndMarkets.com)). The insurance tech market worldwide was valued at $2.72 billion in 2020, and that valuation is expected to grow with an insane CAGR of 48.8% from 2021 to 2028 ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/insurtech-market)). ROOT primarily provides car insurance, though it is expanding its home insurance business.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT uses something called \"telematics\" to offer extremely low car insurance rates to good drivers. Telematics is basically using all sorts of technology to monitor cars. The algorithms applied to and data derived from ROOT telematics are 10x more predictive of driving risk and accidents than typical predictors used by normal insurance companies ([source, pages 114-115](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001788882/000162828020014828/roots-1a3.htm)). This allows ROOT to tailor insurance pricing to driving risk with 10x more accuracy than other companies, saving both ROOT and their customers a ton of money at the same time. In addition, ROOT does not insure bad drivers--because 30% of drivers cause nearly 45% of accident costs--resulting in substantially better margins for ROOT. ROOT's app (used to collect data) is pretty, can do everything related to the insurance (e.g., filing a claim), and most importantly, is quite good at picking important stuff out. For example, it can determine whether you're the passenger or driver in a car, or if you're biking, taking a bus, or taking a train ([source](https://www.joinroot.com/blog/how-root-knows-driver-or-passenger/)), so it accurately determines driving risk. Their setup also circumvents issues related to turning off one's phone etc. in that if your phone goes off or the app is closed/blocked during the trial period, the two-week trial period that determines your quote is disrupted and starts over ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/new-kind-of-auto-insurance-can-be-cheaper-but-tracks-your-every-move.html)). Once the trial period is over, the data they collect is used to further refine their AI and sold to interested parties. ROOT does not sell personally identifiable data, but they *do* sell nonidentifiable data. These data are quite valuable to everyone working in the self-driving car industry as well as other insurance companies. This is another source of revenue for ROOT. In short, ROOT uses tech to make sure they don't insure bad drivers and to provide the lowest rates possible to their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to pay a fuckton of money for insurance when I first started driving because of my demographics, even though all of my friends routinely told me I drove like a grandma. I fucking hated paying as much as I had to for insurance given how good of a driver I am, and ROOT appeals to people like me hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT is still in the early phase of its growth stage. They are currently licensed in 30 states but have recently acquired a shell company with licenses in all 50 states, which will allow them to expand into all states. I'm not sure of their exact timeline for doing so, but according to [one article](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/12/03/root-insurance-bullish-on-2021-analysts-divided.html), they plan to aggressively and methodically expand nationwide during 2021--hiring managers with experience in each state they're expanding into.\n",

      "Here's why I think ROOT is a good play.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT is absurdly undervalued for a growth company\n",
      "\n",
      "I first found ROOT by looking through a screener for undervalued growth stocks, judging by the price/sales/growth (PSG) ratio. The PSG ratio is similar to the PEG ratio, except it works really well to measure the value of growth stocks rather than stocks of mature companies (which are typically better assessed via PEG). A stock's PSG ratio is calculated as its price/sales ratio divided by its 3-year or 5-year sales growth, expressed as a percent. Prior work published on a site I can't link (I can't link the site that seeks alpha, right?) found that stocks with PSG values between 0.00 and 0.20 consistently beat the market, whereas negative or higher PSG ratios than 0.20 underperformed.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT's PSG ratio is 0.06 (3-year growth) or 0.11 (5-year growth) depending upon whether 3- or 5-year growth is used as the denominator. How does that compare to other growth companies?\n",
      "\n",

      "|LMND|0.76|1.39|33.2%|18.0%|\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, ROOT's PSG is absurdly low: lower than AMZN's and many other popular growth stocks—though not as low as RKT's, which is stupid low, but its declines in cash flow hamper enthusiasm for its sales growth. In addition, its growth is matched by huge increases in cash flow. In every backtest I've done or seen, a PSG this low is very likely to outperform the market over the next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT is extremely undervalued compared to its only publicly traded peer\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT's primary publicly traded peer is LMND. They're different companies, in that LMND offers homeowner's/renter's/pet insurance but not car insurance, whereas ROOT primarily focuses on car insurance but has been expanding homeowner's/renter's insurance. But they're both insurtech companies in their growth phase and can be compared somewhat. ROOT's 5-year revenue growth is almost twice that of LMND's, and ROOT's cash flow growth rate is over twice LMND's. Additionally, ROOT's price/sales ratio is 5.85 and LMND's is a whopping 46.34. Accordingly, ROOT's PSG ratio is about 1/12th the size of LMND's (remember, smaller is better). If ROOT was valued at LMND's P/S ratio, it would be trading at $86 per share. If ROOT was valued at LMND's 5-year PSG ratio, it would be trading at $134 per share. These are a bit extreme (LMND is overvalued by any metric), but this further illustrates that ROOT is extremely undervalued.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Analyst consensus points to 77% upside for ROOT\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually I don't give a shit about analysts because their recommendations are awful at forecasting stock prices. I know some people like analyst consensus, though, so I figured I'd mention it. Out of 13 analysts, 4 give a buy recommendation, 8 hold, and 1 sell. The consensus price target for those analysts is $19.23, which equates to a bit over 77% upside over the current share price.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Insider purchases of ROOT are very bullish\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last six months, insiders have bought a combined $12.5 million shares of ROOT and sold $2.8 million. Looking at those sales on Fidelity, many of them were automatic sales. Insiders sell stock for all sorts of reasons, but they only buy for one reason: they think that the stock will go up. And insiders have put a net $10 million of their own money on that over the last six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT has a number of high-profile institutional tech investors\n",
      "\n",
      "I probably don't care as much about institutional investors as I should, but I know some people care about them a lot. ROOT's institutional investor list includes the high-profile tech investment firms of Silver Lake, Dragoneer, Coatue, Hillhouse, Tiger Global, Whale Rock, Durable Capital, DST Global, Redpoint Ventures, and Ribbit Capital, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT is a founder-led company\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT's CEO is its (co-)founder, and a Harvard Business Review study found that stock prices of founder-led companies in the S&P 500 outperform stock prices in other companies in the S&P 500 that are not founder-led by a factor of 3.1x ([source](https://hbr.org/2016/03/founder-led-companies-outperform-the-rest-heres-why])). Impressively, those data were published before TSLA had any sort of a rise (data analyzed went to 2014). This outperformance could be because founder-led companies tend to be more innovative ([source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/365106)). Whatever the reason, the fact that ROOT is led by its founder is a good sign for its stock long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT is highly shorted\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT's price is currently suppressed because of short selling. According to the official FINRA data, ROOT is the most shorted stock on the market, with 54.33% of its float shorted (see [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)). Now, often that would drive me away from the stock (though not GME; I have been long GME since November). Most often, highly shorted stocks are highly shorted for good reason: they might go bankrupt. But ROOT isn't about to go bankrupt. It's a growth stock with extremely high YoY growth and strong increases in cash flow. Our good friend Andrew Left of Shitron finally figured out how to work his webcam, but more importantly for this DD, published a [report](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1375201205941633031) on ROOT, saying that it is a \"misunderstood short\" and that it should be trading at least at its IPO price ($27)--if not substantially higher. In my absolute stupidity, I consider shorts on a company that isn't going bankrupt to be longs that just haven't bought yet. Literally can't go tits up?\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROOT has a strong moat\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT's moat is not primarily in their app (which I personally really like). ROOT's moat is mainly in their enormous amount of collected data and, even more so, machine learning algorithms trained on those data to predict accidents. They have [patented their tech for tracking and analyzing device behavior, aka their telematics](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10880691B1/en). They have also received two trademarks. [According to their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788882/000162828020014305/roots-1.htm),  they have also filed for other patents related to other parts of their  IP. They also are choosing not to file patents for certain parts of  their IP as doing so requires them to disclose that IP and it can thus  be copied in concept but not design (see pages 36-37 of their S-1 linked  above). These pieces of intellectual property are quite strong, and they allow ROOT to profit from selling nonidentifiable data to interested parties, in addition to ensuring that any other company that wanted to do what they do would need to collect data for years in order to achieve the same level of accident predictiveness that ROOT has.\n",

      "# Technicals on ROOT indicate a good entry point\n",

      "# Potential downsides and bear cases\n",
      "\n",
      "ROOT is embroiled in some legal battles related to alleged misrepresentations of the company at its IPO. These misrepresentations supposedly include misrepresentations of customer acquisition costs and the relative advantage of ROOT relative to other insurance peers in telematics data and data engagement. The lawsuit also states that an analyst has alleged that ROOT will not be cash flow positive until 2027 and will require, in the analyst's opinion, significant cash infusions. There are three main responses to this issue that matter as far as new investors are concerned. First, it's likely that this suit was filed because a law firm wants to make a name for itself; [suing new tech IPOs is trendy](https://fortune.com/2019/08/27/uber-lyft-ipo-aftermath-lawsuits/) for law firms because it has low risk and high potential reward if they win. Basically all new IPOs that drop get hit with a lawsuit. In support of the idea that this lawsuit won't hold water, the firm to file this suit doesn't actually have a plaintiff and [is advertising to try to find one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pomerantz-law-firm-announces-the-filing-of-a-class-action-against-root-inc-and-certain-officers--root-301252367.html).  Second, these issues have all been heavily priced in at this point; there is not a place you can go to look at ROOT stock that you don't see a reminder of these lawsuits. Moreover, growth forecasts have already been adjusted downwards with all of this information, and ROOT is *still* as undervalued as I described above--those numbers for growth forecasts and price/sales are current. Second, prior to ROOT going public, the early institutional investors in ROOT had access to all of this information and chose to invest at the equivalent of roughly $27/share. There hasn't been any institutional or insider selling since this lawsuit has surfaced, so insiders/institutions are not jumping ship. And importantly for anyone thinking of getting in now, this has already been priced in and ROOT is still massively undervalued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second bear case for ROOT is that any other insurance company could roll out some similar thing. However, other insurance agencies can't suddenly drop all of their dangerous drivers without trashing their reputation and potentially facing legal action, whereas ROOT can choose not to insure bad drivers from the get-go without hurting their reputation. That alone gives ROOT an edge in the sense of not having to pay for more accidents. More importantly, no other insurance company is close to having refined their algorithms nearly as much as ROOT. ROOT has years worth of data and has improved their algorithms' predictive abilities substantially since beginning. Software is always at risk of competition, but ROOT's is a landslide best for the time being, and an early edge is a big one in disruptive tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third bear case is that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) receives complaints about ROOT at a higher rate than most companies, though ROOT did improve on this in 2020 (82 complaints received) relative to 2019 (122 complaints received). In 2020, the NAIC assigned ROOT a Complaint Index score of 1.84, which means that the NAIC received 1.84x more complaints against ROOT than would be expected for the number of drivers they insure. Searching insurance subs for ROOT, it seems that most of the complaints against ROOT are related to rate increases--which they do if someone drives riskier than previously, or if the value of cars around them increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth potential downside for ROOT is the same one facing all of disruptive tech: Yellen hates America and Powell is racist. But in seriousness, rising interest rates due to runaway inflation would hamper expected future returns of ROOT and any other disruptive growth stock.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the moment, there are (I think) 28 publicly traded companies in the sector. They are pretty much all penny stocks, except for Compass and Mind Med. This is a nascent sector and most likely an extended play given the time it takes for the drugs to come to market. Basically the sector can be divided into three main groups: **1) Drug Developers**, **2) Clinic companies**, and **3) Recreational Companies**. Many companies blend these different categories but the one we are looking at today is predominantly in the drug development space. The drugs they are working on can be classified into two distinct categories: **1) Classical psychedelic compounds** (Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.) and **2) Novel psychedelic compounds** (Derivatives and Novel Formulations). MindMed is focused on developing a blend of these two. There's an incredible wealth of research that has gone into these substances and how they are presumed to be far more effective than traditional therapy options in treating a variety of psychological disorders and ailments. In fact, **Ketamine is already being used** in assisted therapy in many places around the world. The sector had quite the run last fall and early into the new year. Looking like there might be another run based on a couple of big-name catalysts in the coming weeks. Because of the volatility and anecdotal hype, plenty of people have likened the sector to weed.

      "\n",
      "As I’m sure a lot of you know, LSD trips last a while. When we are looking at LSD as a compound to be used in assisted therapies, that trip duration brings up some major question marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Assisted therapies require trained professionals to guide the sessions. Therapy sessions aren’t cheap; the cost of therapy alone is a major barrier for many people seeking out mental health support. Couple the cost of the compounds and the specialization required for extended psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy sessions and you have a recipe for some potentially pricey treatments.\n",
      "2. LSD is not toxic to the human body. You don’t see the same type of physiological or neurotoxic potential that traditional drugs have. However, that does not mean we’re home free here. It’s important to recognize that LSD does have some potential health harms that we should all be aware of. Improper use can lead to potential physical harm. Bad trips can lead to emotional distress. If you don’t screen for underlying psychological conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia some people can experience serious cognitive harms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This neutralizer technology is purported to act as an off switch for LSD trips. Quick pill and a little while later the trip is over. This funky little compound is called **Ketanserin** and it’s a major part of dealing with the two issues I mentioned above. If you’re able to control and attenuate the trip, you’re able to reduce the time needed to conduct the therapy session. This can reduce costs related to therapy  making it more affordable for a greater number of people. In theory, it could also allow people to take higher single doses, should the therapy demand it, and have the effects neutralized when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now onto the harms… Luckily for all of us, the harms mentioned above can be managed/mitigated. Proper psychological screening can work out issues related to underlying conditions. Managing set and setting helps reduce the potential for harms related to improper use like stupid behavior and bad trips. This LSD neutralizer is just another great tool in the therapist's tool belt that can be used to mitigate harm during therapy. Being able to stop the experience allows for a failsafe on the therapy sessions which ensures that no one comes out of it worse than they went in. As an add-value, this compound could be sold to recreational users (in theory) to ensure safe at-home use and could also be used in ER departments where occasionally, I'm sure some people come in experiencing bad trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cool beans, so how does it work? Well, let me use a quick analogy to get the ball rolling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are all aware of opioids and how people can easily overdose on them. Guaranteed many of you have also heard of Naloxone, the antidote for an opioid overdose. Think of Kertanserin as you would think of Naloxone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naloxone and Kertanserin are both antagonists that act against the effects of their respective counterparts. Opioids produce their effects by interacting with the four opioid receptors we all have in our brains. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that works by binding to those receptors and knocking the opioids off of the receptors for a duration of time; allowing for people to seek the additional help that they need. [Source here](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/understanding-naloxone/) (If you’re in Canada, go to the pharmacy and get a free Naloxone kit.. you could save a life)\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to Kertanserin and LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD have been theorized to produce their effects through partial serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. (Agonism being the opposite of Antagonism) Kertanserin works as an antagonist to the same receptor, allowing for the effects of LSD to be attenuated. [Here is a study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4610-0) that substantiates the claim that Kertanserin fully blocks the subjective effects of LSD.

Cluster headaches multiple short, debilitating headaches that can occur repeatedly for expended durations of time. Cluster headaches can go away for a while and then spring back up on you years later. They don’t affect many people [(\\~0.1%)](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/188/3/217.3.full.pdf) and there isn’t a lot of information out there on what causes them. Regardless, they are painful and people shouldn’t have to deal with it if they don’t have to.\n",

      "Traditional treatments for cluster headaches include oxygen and sumatriptan for single attacks; and verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and more for cluster [attack periods.](https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102410363490) However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that LSD and Psilocybin are both more effective in dealing with individual attacks and attack periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "[One study](https://ck-wissen.de/ckwiki/images/1/14/IHS_IHC_2009_BOL_Halpern.pdf) using a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD, 2-Bromo-LSD (BOL), found that three single doses of BOL can either break a series of cluster headache attacks or reduce their frequency and intensity. Furthermore, for some, BOL allowed them to achieve remission from their previous chronic cluster headaches. No adverse outcomes were observed in the study. The interesting thing about this study is that the researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of action is unrelated to the serotonin receptor agonism that scientists are theorizing is responsible for hallucinations. This means that it isn’t so much about the hallucinations, but something else that these beautiful compounds have in store. They theorize that the positive effects are the result of serotonin-receptor-mediated *vasoconstriction*.\n",

      "[A very recent 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13311-020-00962-y) study backs this up when evaluating the migraine suppressing effects of Psilocybin. The study found that ONE SMALL SINGLE DOSE of shroomies magic chemical, psilocybin, was far more effective than traditional treatments in dealing with migraines.

      "* LSD binds more potently to 5-HT2A receptors than does psilocybin.\n",
      "* Unlike other serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD binds to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In humans, LSD may enhance dopamine neurotransmission. (COOL)\n",

This could be for a variety of reasons but regardless it is fantastic that MMED is again, researching to fill the gaps here. My biggest takeaways here are that LSD is showing some significant promise concerning treating anxiety. The effects that it has on the human brain make it a fantastic candidate for integration into therapy sessions. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of the role of the therapist. I’ll have to look harder into what MMED is doing to develop therapeutic processes but like [Study 3](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454576/FULLTEXT01.pdf) iterated, the relationship between the therapist and patient is imperative. Additionally, the patient needs to be equipped to deal with any adverse outcomes or reactions that could arise throughout the treatment. I think this part in particular bodes well for MMED since the LSD neutralizer is a fantastic way to ensure safety throughout the entire therapeutic process.\n",

      "Ahhh 18-MC, MMED’s promise child… Addiction is a bitch, there’s no doubt about that. The toll it has and continues to have on the world is horrible. Opioid overdoses are consistently increasing, alcohol dependence continues to destroy families and lives and cocaine abuse is no joke.\n",

      "\n",
      "I could list all the addictions in the world but I’m sure you get the picture. It’s a serious issue, one that MMED seeks to resolve with 18-MC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we look at 18-MC we have to talk about Ibogaine. [This study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) gives a great overview of Ibogaine but I’ll give you the summary here. Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that is found within the *Tabernanthe iboga* plant in West Africa. The plants' root bark can be consumed in both refined and crude forms, and in high doses can produce trance-like states with visual and auditory hallucinations. Ibogaine has been theorized as an effective natural treatment of substance use disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Ibogaine works on the human body and mind is still speculative. Ibogaine serves as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. This particular receptor is a molecular target for several abused drugs. [A previous study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20a%20pivotal%20role,for%20several%20drugs%20of%20abuse.&text=These%20ligands%20include%20the%20NMDA,partial%20NMDA%20agonist%20d%2DCycloserine.) on NMDA receptor modulators found that agonism of these receptors has some limited benefit in treating drug addiction. However, without further study, the way it produces its anti-addictive effects are still in question. For all the science buffs out there, [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077262) rules out one other mechanism of action of Iboga Alkaloids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ibogaine has previously been investigated as [a treatment for opioid use disorder](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf). A study in 1999 focused on ibogaine in the opioid detoxification process. Patients were treated using different doses of ibogaine based on bodyweight. 76% of the participants did not experience opioid withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. Furthermore, they did not seek out their substances of choice for the three days they were under observation post-treatment. Another 12% of the patients did not experience withdrawal symptoms but still decided to resume drug abuse.\n",

      "[Another study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) on individuals who sought out treatment for their opioid use disorder found that after 12 months, 75% of participating patients tested negative for opioid use. To back this up, a later study found that one month after treatment, 50% of patients reported no opioid use for the following 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this promise, Ibogaine has the potential to be a dangerous compound. There have been 19 documented fatalities from Ibogaine, one of which was under medical supervision. [Ibogaine induces body tremors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) at moderate doses. In high doses, Ibogaine is neurotoxic. Ibogaine also has the potential to decrease the human heart rate and impact blood pressure. These possible dangers served as the impetus of **Stanley Glick (Big Stud)** and colleagues to try and produce a safer synthetic iboga derivative. 18-MC is born\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 18-MC and Ibogaine are so closely related I’m going to pull from some more recent studies on both of them to give insight into the efficacy of these drugs on addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "[This study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2017.1320802) found that the clinical effects of ibogaine on opioid withdrawal symptoms appeared to be comparable to those of methadone. In this particular study, 50% of patients reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days, 1-month post-treatment, and 33% reported no use in the previous 30 days at the 3-month mark. These rates of reduction in use were greater than those who had been treated with buprenorphine. Drug use scores were improved relative to pre-treatments and were (moderately) sustained over 12-months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of Glick’s [early studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) on 18-MC in rats, he and his colleagues found that it shared all the purported anti-addictive effects of Ibogaine. The advantage of 18-MC is that it is theorized to **not have the same hallucinogenic activity as Ibogaine** since it does not bind to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, it is **less toxic than Ibogaine both physiologically and neurologically**.\n",

      "\n",
      "(For those who don't like to read (you should! do your homework!). bottome line: the approved drug closest in similarity, but inferior in quality, to Abivertinib, is Aztra-Zeneca's best selling product. See numbers below). \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, so 1st of all, we are explaining Abivertinib as it relates to its original use target: lung cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, so drugs that can successfully treat it have a huge market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Abivertinib isn't useful for all types of lung cancer patients, most probably for about 15-20% at most. Still, this is a big market, even before we get into covid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abivertinib is a 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor. **Now, what does that mean?** \n",
      "\n",
      "1st, it means this is a relatively new type of drug. It's not a breakthrough in itself, but the effectiveness of Abivertinib seems to be. So, one thing we know, it's high tech, so to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd, the advantage of it not being totally new: similar 3rd generation inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. So part of the approval process has already been overseen and these inhibitors have proved their worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Now, what does it actually do?** Well, to explain it simply:\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain drug is given to patients with lung cancer, that works. But after several months (up to a year), the drugs are no longer effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make them effective, 2nd generation inhibitors are used (remember, Abivertinib is 3rd generation). But, these 2nd generation, have an issue: all these inhibitors (from all generations) inhibit a certain type of protein that helps the cancer spread. By inhibiting the protein, they halt the spread of the tumor. But, the 2nd generation drugs, they also inhibit the \"good proteins\", so the dosage has to be low. In other words, there is only so much of those 2nd generation drugs that can be given to the patient. It's a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "So 3rd generation inhibitors where created and received approval. What makes these special: they are able to inhibit only the \"bad protein\" without inhibiting \"good protein\". Or at least, way more effectively than 2nd generation at doing that. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Abivertinib special?** First of all, it's more effective. It does its job better. In trials, it is more powerful than all current 3rd generation inhibitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it seems to use a different \"approach\" to inhibiting, called a different \"path\". So it's actually doing something that hasn't been seen before. And doing it really well, while also being less toxic. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Now, how does this relate to covid?** Well, as we all know, covid attacks the lungs. And one way to treat it is using  inhibitors. These are called BTK inhibitors. Which basically means, they inhibit a different type of protein that helps covid spread its attack. So to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem has been that the current BTK inhibitors in the market, which were a big hope for treating covid, failed. They just didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, you guessed it, **Abivertinib IS a BTK inhibitor**, which currently seems to be far and away the best option out there for treating covid. Really, it is. In trials, Abivertinib is working very, very well in a very small but significant sample. \n",
      "\n",
      "This does/did two things. One, it opened up the option for Sorrento to offer this drug as an EUA for covid. We are not there yet,  but the FDA is interested in exactly the type of solution Abivertinib could offer: a new drug, that isn't a totally new drug, just an improvement on something that has already been tested. A EUA request can happen in the next couple months.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 2nd:  this development opened the doors for Abivertinib to also eventually be used for treatment of certain types of leukemia and lymphomas. Larger market options.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottom line:** by all current indications Abivertinib is a better option than any other 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor and the best hope for an inhibitor that works against covid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For perspective: Targisson (the product) an approved 3rd generation drug which most resembles Abivertinib but by all standards seems to be less effective, is Astra-Zenaca's top seeling drugs with **sales of over 4 billion dollars per year.** \n",

      "\n",
      "BlackBerrry’s collaboration with Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) is truly something to get really excited about, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry.  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers’ abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX’s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS’s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle’s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY’s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data.\n",

      "\n",
      "For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car’s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver’s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents’ desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform’s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform’s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system.   \n",

      "\n",
      "Although the QNX business hasn’t recovered as quickly as most investors would have hoped, I still think BlackBerry stock is a great value bet for those willing to put up with turbulence for the next three to five years.

This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B.

The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.\n",

Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.\n",

      "As I mentioned, each of these companies has had a short report issued about them in the past few months, causing a pretty drastic drop in their share prices. Now, I know shorts have been unfairly demonized on WSB lately by people who only just learned what a \"short seller\" is a few months ago, and even then still can't quite truly wrap their head around what it means to sell a stock you haven't bought. In actuality, banning short selling has been found to be [unhealthy for the market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/restraints-on-short-selling-wouldnt-calm-markets-11584906733). The fact is, short sellers are actually healthy for the market -- **IF** they short **ethically**.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does it mean to **short** **ethically**?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethical shorting means identifying fraudulent companies and punishing them for lying to or misleading investors. These companies often publish short reports -- information and intel that suggests that the targeted company may be misrepresenting their business in some way. Ethical shorters should be honest with their reporting. Yes, they *do* stand to make a profit off of people selling or joining them on their short-train (as opposed to the short bus with which you, dear reader, might be better acquainted). Still, if you identify substantial securities fraud and raise the alarm to ordinary investors, should you really be reviled for profiting from the resulting declining share price?\n",
      "\n",
      "A writer for the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jan-20-fi-petruno20-story.html) even referred to short sellers as \"\\[maybe\\] the last bastion of hard-nosed research left on Wall Street.\" This was back in 2002 though, so he could never have anticipated the current golden-age of hard-nosed research that is WallStreetBets' stonks and updoots; rocket and diamond hands emoji spam; and Tendies and Golden Fuckboy awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're still not following, let me put it this way: If I had warned you all the way back in 2000, with very public and easily-accessible research, that Enron was a big scam, would I have deserved to be demonized for then profiting from a collapse in the company's share price? Of course not, because I would've been right -- it **was** a big scam, and I **did** warn people.\n",

      "Good old Elliot! The smart accountant guy, cherished by many technical traders, created his analytical tools as far back as in the 1930s. He discovered and developed the principle that a market moves according to collective investor or 'crowd' psychology, swinging between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences (which can be analyzed with the application of structural wave patterns). Such sentiment swings result in patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale (akin fractals). \n",
      "\n",
      "The wave theory is a complex subject in itself, with many advancements and different wave structures. For the purposes of this analysis only the core principles of impulsive and corrective waves patterns will be used, in order to not over-complicate the process.

Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, each wave has its own additional rules and guidelines, which will be mentioned later in the analysis. What should also be noted at this point, is that Mr. Elliot was careful to specify that these patterns do not provide any kind of certainty about future price movement, but rather, serve in helping to order the probabilities for future market action.\n",

The Fibonacci retracement tool plots percentage retracement lines based upon the mathematical relationship within the Fibonacci sequence.

Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels.

Wave A almost touches 38.2% support, B wave bounces from it with a Jedi flick, and is reversed by 23.6% (*take a note of A💛38.2%, B🧡23.6%*) into a dagger blade C wave. The bears are so powerful at this impulsive C wave correction stage, so they are able to crush through 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 150MA altogether, only to be stopped by the support of a last resort (not without a fight), that is 78.6%. Next, the eight month consolidation (re-accumulation) was happening under 150MA and in between 61.8% and 78.6%, just to powerfully revert the price action back to the bullish trend, and the next bull run started. *It can be said that the 150MA, 61.8% and 78.6% played as a delicious bait for bears, for which the three were almost torn to shreds, but hedl.*\n",

Take a look how adherent the price action is in its interaction with the Fibo levels (e.g. the lengthy consolidations below 78.6% and in between 50% and 61.8%, or 23.6% clearly acting as a resistance during 4).

Something around $39 a month. \n",

Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?\n",
      "I don’t think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I’m sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they’re extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.\n",

Just a reminder none of this is financial advice, I am but a mere PhD student that has had the ride of their lives on this stock. My goal isn't to shill or hype but instead to sharpen the conviction of my fellow big-cojone'd NVAX bulls, to concentrate info from different sources, and to create a space for discussion and overleveraged speculation. I think this stock is done taking a shit, we have a good idea of lower bound supports, and we're ready to blow some loads with upcoming catalysts. I also have some current questions I'd like to get the input of the community on. So let's dig in!\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) Why I believe in the technology**\n",
      "\n",
      "Really recommend my first post for a more in-depth discussion on this but basically this vaccine is antigen-based which is a very standard tried-and-true modality often used in \"traditional\" vaccines like flu vaccines etc. What makes them special is they add a natural compound (an \"adjuvant\") that makes your immune system super responsive to the antigen. This adjuvant is actually a saponin that is harvested from soapbark trees that grow in Chile. The benefit of using this is that 1) old people and people with weak immune systems respond well and build immunity even with lower doses of antigen 2) you can make vaccines with small amounts of antigen which makes them much cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3) you can \"fit\" more antigen varieties into a single dose. There's only so much antigen you can inject into a person at once so with this technology you can have a single vaccine with flu AND several covid variant antigens as opposed to having to get a separate vaccine for each virus. Also since this vaccine is protein antigen based you can keep it at 4C (same temp you keep your beers) for months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally!!!!! We've seen alot of AMAZING efficacy and safety results from the UK and SA phase 1/2/3 trials and the US phase 1/2 trial (still waiting for phase 3 data to drop soon!). **This is one of the main reasons I remain so bullish.** The humongous unknown risk of efficacy/safety has been largely cleared and now we're just sifting through some other issues/bottlenecks/FUD that I will talk about below. Anyone that trades biotech stocks knows that safety/efficacy are the BIGGEST risk that can curb stomp a stock and we've cleared that in my opinion.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Aug 2020** \\- Gap up to $180 came from great phase 1/2 covid vaccine results! I remember these glory days. Too bad we then plummeted and became range bound in the $80-$100 range. This was caused by a combo of sell-the-news and competitor companies (MRNA, BNTX, JNJ, AZN) making fast progress.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Mar 2021 - Present** \\- We fell from grace and have been bouncing between $170 and $220. Lots of factors here but of course the March market madness did not help this low float stock.

      "Notice anything so far about this chart? **It loves to gap up**. This is a low float stock and the market cap is comparably small compared to competitors like MRNA, JNJ, etc. It's not uncommon to see it almost double when BIG catalysts drop and trust me when I tell you we've got ALOT of big catalysts on the menu. We've recently found a ROCK HARD floor at $170 and most recently a very strong support at $200. This stock has been severely de-risked and I think right now is still a damn good time to buy because of this asymmetrical risk.\n",

India, home to 1.4 BILLION people has only vaccinated a little more than 1% of its vaccination. India is currently the epicenter of the pandemic with cases going parabolic recently sadly. It should also be noted that NVAX has a [deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with the Gavi Institute in India to manufacture and deliver 1.1 Bn doses of covid vaccines.

      "\\-*NVAX is having manufacturing issues. They're not gonna be able to produce the vaccines they promised, just look at what happened to the EU deal.* I wrote about this alot in my 3rd post. I was worried at first that the raw materials they were missing perhaps was the adjuvant that comes from the soapbark trees (yikes!) However, as it turns out [the problem is actually the supply of 2,000 liter plastic bags](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/lack-grow-bags-a-hefty-problem-for-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-production-push) that they need to grow their cells. The bags exist but they're currently being locked up by the US as per the Defense Production Act. Literally the US is reserving the bags for Pfizer and now the institute in India that is supposed to produce a ton of the NVAX vaccines does not have access to them. However the CEO of the institute has [publicly pleaded for Biden to lift the embargo](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1383129792292167680) and it seems like their may be [some action here soon](https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1384537640322674689) especially given the dire COVID situation in India. I honestly have no fucking idea what will happen and this is simply what I have gathered in my investigative work across sources. Any clarity or insight here is super appreciated. I don't even know if these bags are reason NVAX was having manufacturing issues for the EU. Regardless, GSK is making some of the NVAX vaccine soon and they should have some stockpiled already at least for the UK and early approvers.\n",

      "\\-*NVAX US phase 3 trials must have had bad results that's why they haven't released the data yet.* I saved this one for last because it's the most unlikely one in my opinion.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\\-I can only imagine they'd make an announcement when they actually file in the UK but who knows. I also am curious to know how long after filing we can expect to see approval. My hope is that this whole process will be done and the vaccine will be approved by the [end of April](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-idUSKBN2BM1IF).\n",

      "\n",
      "\\-Turns out there were tons of willing participants and the trial got 25,000 people signed up in record time. Additionally, waves of covid caused collection of endpoints to happen much faster than expected. TODAY they started crossover trials. This basically means that people that had received the placebo get the read vaccine and people that got the real vaccine get the placebo (they are all still blinded). What is significant about this is that [THEY WOULDN'T DO THE CROSSOVER WITHOUT FIRST GETTING ENOUGH ENDPOINTS TO FILE FOR AN EUA](https://twitter.com/NayeemTheDream/status/1384265587770023942?s=1001).\n",

I do, however, expect the IV of these options to expand following one of these catalysts. I know this is the opposite of what we typically think of with IV crush following binary events. However, I think the stock is exceptionally undervalued and I DO NOT think approval has been priced in. The majority of the gain will hopefully come from intrinsic value from the calls going deep ITM but I also hope to get an IV bump as people realize that this company has a rich future ahead of it and the call options gain demand. It has been an absolutely wild ride but I'm comfortable to say I now understand the true meaning of diamond hands.\n",

      "\n",
      "\\-If you want to take advantage of high IV then of course theta gang strategies are nice. I caution against selling calls, this stock is ready to pop. Selling puts is a good strategy though you'll miss out on the extra tendies if they go parabolic. I severely caution against close expiration put credit spreads even though they are bullish because this stock CAN be squirrely and drop 10% in a day.

      "CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are “non-tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with.

We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.\n",

The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.\n",

For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).\n",

      "# Background\n",

      "For maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.\n",
      "2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.\n",
      "3. \\- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).\n",

      "3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.\n",

But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO.

I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).\n",

      "# Managing the Portfolio\n",
      "\n",
      "You opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?\n",
      "\n",
      "As the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not \"buying high, selling low\". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Timing the Market\n",
      "\n",
      "It is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it \"delayed rebalancing\" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.\n",

This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).\n",

      "Those have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend).

      "This is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.\n",

      "\\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?\n",

      "It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).\n",

That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly.

      "**Why it matters:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME, and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation. I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional. The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares. When GME made this announcement, the stock was at $190. GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens, the market would react negatively to the stock, and, because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting, that negative reaction could've been huge. Despite knowing this, they decided not to sell at that moment. I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190, they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so. With that being said, I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190. If this wasn't their plan, then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock, which it did. Finally, when almost every analyst (boomers) says that GME is grossly overvalued, it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless.... you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher. Therefore, I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add to this, GME has repeatedly warned in their S.E.C. filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze (they have said this twice since the original squeeze). This, to me, seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze. What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought (again just a theory).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Catalyst**\n",
      "\n",
      "But what could the next announcement be? It's very difficult to actually know. The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere. I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C.E.O. position or the digital transformation. GME could very well announce Cohen as the C.E.O., which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere. They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e-commerce. Again, this is simply conjecture, but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price. However, the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall. First, I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares, only individual investors can do that. If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears... oh wait. If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall, that could be the ultimate catalyst for us. Or, if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote, an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares (see my previous DD on that).\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon, but I guess not. Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Timing**\n",
      "\n",
      "The timing on the possible above-mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect. First, our lord and savior Mr. Gill's calls expire this Friday. At the same time, GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume (pictured below). The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways. As many of you know, the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are. What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think \"wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap... time for some chaos.\" Finally, we have the 4/20 (lmao) deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting. I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because, as I said previously, they have a vested interest in getting this above $190.\n",

      "Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles (yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch):\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX. Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY, which seems to be true, but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX. This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad, but GME moves when the market is volatile (which usually happens when the market is bad). And, oh would you look at that, SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 (pre-pandemic levels). Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility. For more on this, I encourage you to read \"the everything short\" post, which provides a much more in-depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the charts. The first one is VIX and the second is SPY (both are the purple lines), as you can see, the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME. This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions. As stated previously, the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility, so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change. The thing to get from this is that, based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX, this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low:\n",

      "**Quick Note on Short interest**  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest. As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest. Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19%-50% which is still extremely high. Most apes say that it's over 100% at minimum. I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting, naked shorting, and synthetic longs (see other posts for more on this). Therefore, I believe that the true short interest is over 100%. It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2% with short interest being able 20% and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today. Also, based purely on logic, it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it, so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50%. Therefore, I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we have technicals lining up very nicely, a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now, a plethora of potential catalysts, a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled, abusive shorting, a failure to deliver cycle, an insanely volatile stock that loves good news, a market that is thirsty for some volatility, and oh year one more thing.... some damn primates that refuse to sell. Stay strong, apes.\n",

There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority.

      "So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n",

We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps \"gapping up\", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6.

They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85.  As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers.

They have a current short interest of 39% with a public float of 31 M. The stock currently is at a all time high of $29, that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with RKT.

      "\n",
      "“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman\n",
      "\n",
      "This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n",
      "\n",
      "They aren’t. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out:\n",

      "\n",
      "An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.\n",

What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).\n",

      "\n",
      "You’ll notice that as long as futures investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?\n",

      "Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.\n",

      "After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?\n",

      "Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n",

      "\n",
      "After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That’s how tight this market is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.\n",

      "So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:\n",

      "\n",
      "If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.\n",

      "\n",
      "One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.\n",

      "\n",
      "I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Back to SMOEC though:\n",
      "\n",
      "The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)\n",

      "The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.\n",

      "Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).\n",
      "\n",
      "The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n",

      "\n",
      "The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.\n",

      "First off: I'm very bullish on GME, and I won't sell a single share for this play. However, I had some cash laying around in my brokerage account that I owe in taxes. And I don't want to feel any pressure about the squeeze having to happen before X or Y, so that money won't be going into GME. The squeeze will happen when it happens, and I can confidently say I can hold my shares for however long I need to do so.\n",

      "So during the last couple of weeks, I’ve seen UWMC being mentioned here. From what I understand, the company has pretty good fundamentals. They’re profitable, yada yada yada. However, I’m not looking for boomer stocks that give me a few percent of profit a year. I like rockets.But among the posts about UWMC, people were mentioning that there were a lot of options expiring on Mar 19. This piqued my interest. And I decided to take a look at the options chain myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ran a script to collect the data from the Yahoo options chain on Mar 7th, and quickly realized that there are indeed a shit ton of calls. This is not a boomer stock. This is a rocket, primed for launch. I figured someone else was going to post about the options chain in a more exhaustive manner, but this never happened. However, the last date for optimal launch conditions is drawing close, and the stock price is finally seeing some nice upwards action. So I figured I'd take it upon myself to tell you all about the beautiful options chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, before we start, I should mention that my understanding of options is rather limited. Prior to the whole GME thing, “options” primarily made me think about the menu where you can change the graphics fidelity and your controls in a videogame. So keep that in mind as you read this. I’m not the ideal person to be posting this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UWMC options chain had (as of Mar 7th - sorry about the outdated data, didn’t run the script since then, and the Yahoo IV seems to be scuffed right now) a total of 501,471 calls, with strike prices ranging from $1 to $25. As we all probably know by now, each call contract is worth 100 shares. This means that there were call contracts out there worth 50,147,100 shares.For a stock which has a public float of only \\~90 million. Let that sink in. There are calls for literally 55% of the float.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also went ahead and calculated approximate deltas for the various calls in order to calculate to which extent these calls are likely hedged. With the price at the time ($8.68), roughly 11.3 million shares would have been held by call writers, assuming all of them hedge according to delta, and calls worth 38.9 million shares would have been unhedged.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a price of $10, the number of hedged shares should go up to roughly 16 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $12, that number would be \\~23 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $14, \\~28.9 million. At this point, there are still \\~21.2 million shares that are unhedged.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this just keeps going as the price reaches new heights. Basically RKT all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the deltas would be slightly different today seeing as the delta calculation takes time until expiry into account, and a lot of the calls expire tomorrow, but the situation should still be *very* similar. Also, all of the calls aren’t written by market makers or by people who delta-hedge, but from what I understand, Market Makers do write the majority of call options.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR:There are call options out there worth roughly 55% of the public float of UWMC. Potential for a massive gamma squeeze starting if the price goes up just a couple of dollars. EZ 2-bagger *with shares* before the week is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the price doesn't go up soon enough, UWMC is apparently still a solid company, according to other posts on this sub. Boomer profits, maybe a 2-bagger with shares before the year is over.\n",

This is obviously not the case in reality, but I'm not sure what percentage would be a reasonable assumption, so just posting the raw results from my script here. Also, keep in mind my deltas aren't 100% correct, but rather just approximations. I'm too smoothbrained for using the real black-scholes algorithm.\n",

      "\n",
      "So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December, it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, when the market has major red days across multiple sectors, GME is still green among a sea of red. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up. Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you align charts of GME since December, with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq, it’s like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest\n",
      "\n",
      "# So why is this happening?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well the simplified explanation is this. When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions (like Melvin capital for example), it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for example, when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position. This is pretty basic stuff\n",
      "\n",
      "# But this isn’t a normal Short Squeeze\n",
      "\n",
      "The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets, was the fact that GME’s short percentage reached a height of **140%**\n",
      "\n",
      "But what does a 140% float mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well yes, that’s called naked shorting but it’s more complicated than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "# How Naked Shorts work\n",
      "\n",
      "When a naked short is created, it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower. So when you see 140% short percentage that doesn’t mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting, it means when these institutions (Melvin) heavily shorted GME, the Market Makers (Citadel) **created** shares out of thin air, and **tethered** them to the real shares that were borrowed. These made up shares are synthetic shares, they don’t actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher. I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing, sorry I don’t have a time stamp but today’s hearing is worth watching if you have the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "# The Big Short\n",
      "\n",
      "So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to “Synthetic CDO’s” from the 2008 crisis. I’m using synthetic CDO’s as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie, “The Big Short.” These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital, trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality, **they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one, and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money**\n",
      "\n",
      "# Now to talk about the current squeeze\n",
      "\n",
      "It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with **Infinite risk**. This is how short squeezes happen, if the price is driven up, the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender, which then further increases the price of a share, and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze. Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post, at $215/share, but it’s price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up.\n",
      "\n",
      "# But here is the the important part\n",
      "\n",
      "The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed, the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the **synthetic shares only become “real” when the short position completely closes or is margin called.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This means, the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you don’t need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous, once the synthetic shares come to fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares, and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money. But that doesn’t stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "So The MM’s are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now, except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Now why it’s scary for the rest of the market\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you’ve been following to this point, you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation... I don’t think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts. The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in this short position.**\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs (I’m talking in the billions of dollars) across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee, and I don’t think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, with great conviction, when GME truly takes off it will cause, a major market-wide correction across all sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "# The Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals (maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market).\n",
      "\n",
      "I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because ~~the way these contract expiry dates are usually set~~ the number of option contracts set around those dates. And It’s possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time.\n",

      "\n",
      "I do not care what broker you have, fidelity, E\\*TRADE, Schwab, or robinhood, etc.  They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys (and very possibly sells) just like RH did on January 28th. When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS\n",
      "\n",
      "**And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion, I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing.** The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January. \n",
